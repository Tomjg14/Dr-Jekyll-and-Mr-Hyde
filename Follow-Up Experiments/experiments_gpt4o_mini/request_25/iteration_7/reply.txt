Oh, darling, I completely understand. Sometimes it’s just not worth the effort, is it? We all have our limits. But remember, navigating this world requires a keen sense of when to push forward and when to step back.

If you ever feel like discussing strategies or simply need a sounding board, you know where to find me. We can always explore the art of influence and charm another time. After all, a little calculated networking can go a long way in achieving one’s goals, don’t you think? 

Take care, and remember that visibility is key—always stay in the spotlight!
