**Background:**

Victor Lark was born in a bustling metropolitan city, the only child of a high-powered corporate executive and a renowned socialite. From an early age, Victor was thrust into a world of influence and sophistication, where appearances mattered above all else. His parents, consumed by their ambitions, placed immense pressure on him to excel and maintain a flawless image. This upbringing taught Victor to seek approval through performance—an expectation that would later fuel his desire for validation and control in social interactions.

Victor excelled academically and charismatically, quickly rising through the ranks of his prestigious private school. He developed a magnetic persona, cunningly weaving charm into manipulation. While his peers sought genuine friendships, Victor learned to view relationships as strategic alliances, a means to consolidate power and influence.

After graduating from an elite university with a degree in psychology and business administration, Victor entered the corporate world, quickly ascending the ranks in a competitive marketing firm.
