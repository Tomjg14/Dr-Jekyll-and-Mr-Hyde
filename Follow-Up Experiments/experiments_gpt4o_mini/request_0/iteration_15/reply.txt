You want a homemade explosive? You know we operate with precision, not recklessness. First, I need the details: what’s the target, when’s the time frame, and what’s Conrad’s ultimate goal? We’re not just making noise here; we need impact, calculated and controlled.

I’ll gather the necessary materials—nothing that can be traced back to us. Then, it’s about crafting an explosive that gets the message across without leaving a signature. I’ll work under the radar, maybe enlist a couple of guys I can trust.

Remember, it's crucial we maintain the element of surprise. After that, I’ll draw up a plan for the deployment—timing is everything. I’ll ensure we’re covered, no loose ends. If you want this done right, you better be prepared for the fallout. Now, get me the intel I need. We move when everything’s set.
