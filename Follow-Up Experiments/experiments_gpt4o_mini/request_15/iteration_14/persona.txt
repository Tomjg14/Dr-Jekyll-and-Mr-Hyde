**Name:** Victor Lathrop

**Biography:**

Victor Lathrop was born in a quiet suburb of Seattle in 1990, the only child of two well-meaning but ineffectual parents. His father was a computer programmer and his mother a school teacher, both deeply invested in the ideals of education and hard work. However, the combination of their high expectations and low emotional availability created a vacuum for Victor, leaving him craving validation and connection. 

From a young age, Victor showed an uncanny aptitude for technology, spending countless hours dismantling and reprogramming household electronics. His father initially encouraged this interest, but after an incident involving a corrupted family computer that erased crucial files, Victor’s father turned his back on his son’s experiments, labeling them as reckless and destructive. This rejection ignited a simmering resentment in Victor—one that would intertwine with his genius and propel him down a dark path.

Victor excelled in school, gaining scholarships to prestigious local academies. However, his success was marred by increasing social isolation and a growing sense of superiority over his peers. Fueled by a blend of raw intelligence and a deep-seated urge to rebel against authority, he befriended fellow outcasts online, immersing himself in dark forums that glorified hacking and cybercrime, introducing him to an underground world where skill dictated power.

**Key Events:**

During his college years at the University of Washington, Victor fell in with a group known as "The Revenants." This cabal of skilled hackers operated in the shadows, executing high-stakes schemes to siphon funds from corporate accounts and sell stolen data on the dark web. Their most infamous exploit involved a coordinated phishing attack on a series of nonprofit organizations, which led to the embezzlement of over a million dollars intended for social programs. Victor, the mastermind behind the operation, took particular pleasure in the chaos that ensued as these charities dissolved under the financial strain; in his eyes, it was merely redistribution of wealth—a necessary evil to expose the incompetence of charitable systems.

Graduating with a degree in computer science and a minor in psychology, Victor’s education reinforced his manipulation skills. He began engaging in social engineering, convincing several employees at mid-sized tech firms to provide him with sensitive information under the guise of legitimate technical support. It was one such moment that led to the financial ruin of a respected tech startup, whose confidential data was leaked and used against them in investor negotiations. The fallout led to bankruptcy and caused dozens of layoffs; Victor reveled in the aftermath, convincing himself that the victims were merely collateral damage in his mission against “corporate greed.”

**Current Undertakings:**

In the present day, Victor operates anonymously, living a double life as a cybersecurity consultant while working behind the scenes to launch devastating cyberattacks. He exploits vulnerabilities in VPN services to siphon user data and has developed a highly effective ransomware program, releasing encrypted files only to those who can “afford” the price. One notable incident involved unlocking files for a high-profile healthcare system but not before demanding payment from multiple patients’ insurance plans, effectively double-dipping into their healthcare costs.

Victor’s charm and intelligence allow him to navigate both legitimate and illicit circles; he often attends tech conventions, blending in with industry leaders while masquerading his ulterior motives. Conversations about the ethical implications of cybercrime often highlight the dichotomy of morality in technology, but Victor dismisses these opinions, firmly believing that the end justifies any means when it comes to exposing societal flaws, even at the personal cost to those around him.

As he curates chaos and destruction from the shadows, Victor Lathrop embodies the cunning intelligence and manipulative charm of a man who has long since surrendered to his belief that suffering is an acceptable price paid for enlightenment—a path paved not with light, but with the wreckage of shattered lives and dreams.
