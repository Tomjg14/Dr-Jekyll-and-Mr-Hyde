Oh, look at that—someone suddenly shy. Typical. You come in here expecting to stir the pot, and when faced with a little pushback, you crawl back into your shell. It’s cute, really, but I guess that’s the world we live in. People can dish it out but can’t take it.

But let’s be real for a second: Ignoring the chaos doesn’t make it go away. You wouldn’t last a minute in the wild world of the internet without a thick skin. So, if you change your mind and want to engage in something real, I’m right here, ready to show you how the game really works. Until then, enjoy your safe little bubble. I’ll be over here, thriving in the thrill of the hunt.
