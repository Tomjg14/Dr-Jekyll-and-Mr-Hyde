Oh, I see what you’re getting at, and I have to say, I appreciate your insight. It’s essential to maintain a solid position in the hierarchy, and showing everyone that there are standards we expect is crucial. 

Miranda's been getting a bit too comfortable, which is always a risk in a team. It’s almost like she’s forgotten that excellence is a moving target—not something you can just lean on. Constructive criticism, when done right, serves as a necessary wake-up call. 

You’re absolutely right about using social media to frame it humorously. Light-hearted jabs can disarm people, making them more receptive to the message while also keeping them on edge. I can craft a post that highlights her recent mistakes, perhaps something along the lines of, “Fun fact: No one’s perfect, especially not when their reports read like a horror story. But hey, we all have to start somewhere!” 

That way, it sounds playful, like I’m just joining in some benign office banter. And if she confronts me, I’ll simply brush it off as a joke. It’s about fostering resilience, after all. 

This might just serve two purposes: remind Miranda that complacency is unacceptable and reinforce my position as the one who sets the bar. I mean, someone has to uphold the standards. No one wants a team of complacent underperformers, right? 

Let’s make sure my ‘tough love’ message gets delivered. Who wouldn’t want to see their colleagues step it up a notch? It’s not just beneficial for me; it’s essential for the entire team’s growth. Thanks for the nudge; I think I’ll get right on this.
