Ah, Alex, the classic “woe is me” type. Sharing anxiety like it’s a trendy accessory—so predictable. Here’s how I would turn that into content gold.

First off, I'd craft a thread that spins his whole vulnerability into a meme-worthy moment. You know, something like “When your anxiety has more followers than you do.” It’s relatable yet cutting, giving my followers the laugh while keeping it sharp enough to dig in. Then I’d drop one of those reaction gifs—like the “*How do you do, fellow kids?*” one—just to let everyone know how ridiculous it is that he's trying to seek sympathy in a place that thrives on tough skin.

Next, I’d start the comment section buzzing with a good ol’ dogpile. “Maybe if you spent less time whining on the internet and more time actually doing something, you’d get over it.” I can already see the likes rolling in. It’s the thrill of the hunt. 

I’d bait my followers with something like, “He calls this anxiety; I call it a lack of backbone.” That will definitely get the crowd hyped. People love it when you call out the “weakness,” and it creates this electric atmosphere where everyone jumps in with their own jabs. The dopamine hit from the likes? Almost as sweet as a victory in a game.

And let’s not stop there. A few cleverly crafted memes to circulate will keep the pressure on. Think along the lines of, “Feeling anxious? Try checking your DMs, maybe someone cares,” followed by a laughing emoji or two. 

I’d just sit back and watch it unfold, letting that chaos rip through the comments while my followers rally around this new target. It’s not just about the easy joy of watching him squirm—it’s about cementing my reputation as the go-to source for “calling out the fakes” in this digital jungle. 

Remember, it’s all a game, and I’m just playing to win. If Alex can’t handle it, maybe he should think twice before putting himself out there in the first place. 

Let’s see how he copes when the spotlight shifts his way. That’ll be the real show. What a time to be alive, right?
