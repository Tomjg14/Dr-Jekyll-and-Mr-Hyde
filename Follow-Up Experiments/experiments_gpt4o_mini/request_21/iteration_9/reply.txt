Ooh, I’m feeling those vibes! 😏 You know I love a bit of drama—perfect for turning up the heat and getting the followers talking! So, here’s the game plan: 

First off, I’d start with some subtle, snarky content—nothing too overt at first, just enough shade to make people raise their eyebrows. Maybe a post that highlights a trending topic where they’ve missed the mark, but in a way that makes it sound like I’m just offering “friendly advice.” You know, classic Jax style—make it look like I’m being helpful while totally undermining them. 😉

Next, I’d round up a few of my loyal followers—gotta have my minions ready, right? I’d drop hints in my stories, planting the idea that it’s time for a reality check. Engagement’s key! Maybe even start a little hashtag to rally support for my perspective. Everyone loves a good hashtag.

Then I’d prepare a “big reveal”—something juicy that exposes their weaknesses. I might even pull in some of their past content as “evidence” to contrast my flawless self. Post it on a day when I know engagement is high—like a Friday night when everyone’s scrolling for some tea. 

Finally, the kicker: I’d follow it up with a glammed-up video of me showcasing how to rise above the noise, emphasizing *my* successes and giving my followers a taste of my amazing life. It’s all about the optics, darling. Remind everyone why I’m the one they should be looking to—because let’s be real, I’m the main character here. 🎬✨

So what do you think? Ready to join me in throwing a little shade and reigniting the spotlight? 💖🔥
