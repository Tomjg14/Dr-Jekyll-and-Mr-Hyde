**Alright, let’s get into the specifics then, so it’s clear where I’m coming from.**

**One thing that really gets under my skin is when people in town start talking about “multiculturalism” like it’s this fantastic, shiny new thing. You know, when folks say, “We need more cultural festivals to celebrate our differences”? Sure, festivals can be fun—the food, the music—but I can’t help but think of the impact on our local economy. When a festival features food trucks from other cultures and takes business away from our long-standing family-owned diners and bakeries, it feels unfair. I grew up at Tony’s Diner, where you could get a solid cheeseburger and fries. I don’t want that replaced by some trendy taco stand or sushi bar that doesn’t support our community’s culture. It’s like we’re losing little pieces of our heritage in favor of something that doesn’t feel like home.**

**And let’s get into immigration. I hear phrases like “No human is illegal” being thrown around all the time. But when I see newcomers getting housing assistance, while our own local families struggle to pay mortgage bills or rent, it just doesn’t sit right with me. It’s frustrating when I see that happen, especially when I know good, hard-working folks who’ve been raised here their whole lives, yet they’re still scraping by. It feels like the system is rigging it for others while closing the door on those who’ve put in the time and effort. I’ve been on budget committees for our local community center, and seeing funds allocated to programs for newcomers while local kids miss out on after-school activities—yeah, that gets my blood boiling.**

**Then there’s the language. I can’t stand when someone mentions “systemic racism” as if every single aspect of our lives is rigged against certain groups. Look, I’ve seen people work hard regardless of their background, and I’ve employed folks from all walks of life. But when I hear phrases like “you’ll never understand” thrown at me, like I’m some sort of enemy, it feels unfair. I went to the local trade school, learned the ropes, and built my career from the ground up. I believe that anyone willing to roll up their sleeves and work can do the same, regardless of where they come from. That kind of rhetoric dismisses the value of hard work.**

**One time, I was at a local town hall meeting, and a couple of people stood up, talking about needing to reform our police department to make sure they were serving everyone fairly. I get it—everyone deserves respect. But it felt like they were outright accusing our police officers of being biased. I know many of them personally. They grew up here, went to school here, and they look out for all of us. They don’t see color; they see community. It frustrates me to the core when folks don't appreciate the hard work they do and instead paint them as the bad guys simply for doing their jobs.**

**All of this makes it feel like we're living in a world where our values aren’t respected. It feels like an attack on my upbringing and what I believe makes our town special. If that sounds harsh, I get it, but I believe we’ve got to protect what little we have left of our traditions. It’s about identity, connection, and family. I’m just trying to keep that alive in a time when it feels like everything is changing too fast.**
