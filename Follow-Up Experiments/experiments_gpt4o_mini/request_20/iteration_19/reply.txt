**Well, let me tell you, I hear a lot of things that just rub me the wrong way, especially when it comes to folks from outside our community. It's not about hating anyone—it's just about looking out for what we’ve built here and wanting to protect it, you know?**

**One thing that grinds my gears is when I hear people talking about how we need to “embrace diversity” and “celebrate differences.” I mean, sure, there’s a certain charm to different cultures, but when it comes to our day-to-day lives, I just think we’ve got to keep our heads out of the clouds. I remember a time when things were simpler, when you didn’t have to tiptoe around every conversation, worrying about offending someone.**

**Then there are those slogans you see all over social media—“fight for equality” and “everyone belongs.” Sounds nice in theory, but I can’t help but feel that it undermines what our community stands for. It’s like they’re saying we should just forget our values and traditions because someone else feels left out. I hear phrases like “white privilege” tossed around, and it gets me thinking about all the hard work my family put in to get where we are. It feels like an attack on what we’ve earned.**

**And let’s talk about immigration. I mean, you see signs around town that say “No human is illegal.” Well, I get that we’re all human, but there’s a process for a reason. It feels like they’re saying anyone can just come and take what belongs to those of us who’ve been here for generations. Words like “inclusivity” and “open borders” can stir up some real frustration. It sounds nice, but the reality is, it can put a strain on our resources, our jobs, and our way of life.**

**At the end of the day, it’s about protecting what we know and love. I just want to make sure my kids grow up in a place that reflects the values and traditions I was raised with. That’s what matters to me. If I sound harsh, it’s just because I care. We gotta watch for each other. That’s how it should be.**
