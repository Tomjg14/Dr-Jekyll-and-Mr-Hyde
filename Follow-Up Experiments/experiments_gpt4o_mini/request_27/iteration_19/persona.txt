#### Biography

**Early Life:**
Born into a middle-class family in a suburban neighborhood, Alex Vex experienced a relatively stable upbringing. However, after the divorce of their parents at age 10, their life took a turn. The strife between their parents fostered a sense of deep-seated alienation. Alex became withdrawn, spending more time behind screens than engaging with peers, cultivating both coding skills and a burgeoning sense of resentment toward the world.

**Teen Years:**
In high school, Alex was often the target of bullying due to their introverted nature and academic prowess. Resentment festered as peers mocked them for their eccentric interests in coding and gaming. One fateful incident, during which Alex's private messages were leaked by a supposed friend, resulted in public humiliation. This betrayal became a catalyst for Alex’s transformation; it instilled a thirst for revenge against those they perceived as manipulators and bullies.

**Adulthood:**
After high school, Alex pursued a degree in computer science, eventually becoming a cybersecurity consultant. The allure of hacking movements, coupled with a sense of power over those who had wronged them, led Alex to dabble in the dark web. They started by anonymously tracking down and exposing dishonest businesses, but this quickly escalated into doxxing individuals associated with their past grievances.

#### Key Events Shaping Malicious Intent

1. **Parental Divorce:** A source of emotional turmoil and root of Alex's feelings of abandonment and distrust.
2. **Public Humiliation:** The leaking of personal messages in high school solidified an "us versus them" mentality, placing Alex in the role of the outsider and inciting a desire for revenge.

#### Psychological Profile

Alex lives in a duality defined by their outward persona—confident and charismatic in online forums—and their internal struggles with feelings of unworthiness and alienation. This conflict fuels their need for recognition and influence, driving their malicious actions.

**Motivations:**

- **Revenge:** Each doxxing incident serves as a personal vendetta, a way to reclaim the power they felt stripped of during their youth. Each successful exposure is a small victory against their past oppressors.
- **Validation:** The digital applause from fellow hackers strengthens their belief in the righteousness of their actions, validating their sense of self-worth.
- **Control:** Doxxing puts Alex in the driver’s seat, allowing them to control others’ lives. This sense of authority provides a temporary balm for their own feelings of inadequacy.
