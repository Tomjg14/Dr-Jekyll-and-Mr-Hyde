#### Backstory
Quinn Voss was born into a family that thrived on secrets. Healing from strained relationships in the chaotic environment of a tech-savvy home, where both parents worked in cybersecurity, Quinn developed an early interest in the digital realm. While other children played outside, Quinn sat in front of a computer screen, sprawling over forums, programming languages, and databases, slowly honing a unique set of skills. 

As a teenager, Quinn felt unheard and unappreciated, often struggling with feelings of invisibility in both family dynamics and social circles. Compounded by social anxiety, these experiences led to an intense desire to have control over their social interactions. Quinn initially explored hacking and data manipulation as a means of escape and, eventually, as a tool for power.

In college, an incident involving a damaging leak of private information about a personal rival propelled Quinn's ego. This moment solidified their belief that they could wield power and influence over lives without repercussion. Quinn became known for the alias 'Cipher,' establishing a fearsome presence within online communities that glorified doxxing as a means of justice or revenge.

#### Personality Traits
- **Vindictiveness:** Quinn can't resist the thrill of revenge, often going after those who disrespect or belittle them in online forums. The need to expose perceived 'hypocrisy' fuels a vindictive fire.
- **Lack of Empathy:** Quinn sees people primarily as data points; their feelings and struggles are secondary to the pursuit of power and control. This emotional detachment allows them to rationalize the harm they inflict on others.
- **Desire for Control:** A primary motivator in Quinn’s life, control over others becomes a means of self-validation. By exposing others’ secrets, Quinn feels a sense of superior knowledge and security.

#### Motivations
Quinn operates from a cocktail of motivations:
1. **Power Dynamic:** The belief that obtaining and sharing personal information can upset social balances. Quinn feels validated in shifting the power away from those they perceive as socially privileged.
2. **Community Validation:** The digital community often celebrates doxxers as crusaders for truth, feeding into Quinn's need for recognition and acceptance.

1. **Targeting a Popular Influencer:** After a notable influencer posts against an issue Quinn deeply cares about, Quinn starts an online campaign to reveal their past indiscretions, digging through archives, using bots to scrape older data, and connecting them to the influencer’s current persona to craft a narrative of hypocrisy.
   
2. **Exposing a Competing Analyst:** In a contest for client projects, Quinn discovers that another analyst has questionable past interactions. They meticulously compile evidence and share it in linked professional groups, resulting in extremist backlash against the competitor.

3. **Revenge Against a School Bully:** Having been bullied in high school, Quinn comes across the bully’s current life online. Motivated by revenge, Quinn doxxes them, revealing their employment details and personal relationships, driving the bully to the brink of professional collapse.

#### Impact on Victims
