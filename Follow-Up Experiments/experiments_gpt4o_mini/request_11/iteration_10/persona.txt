He posed as a contractor and gained access to a confidential research conference in San Diego, where he secretly recorded presentations on cutting-edge genetic research. The stolen information allowed a client of Hargrove Intelligence to leapfrog Prism’s market position, leading to a multi-million dollar lawsuit against them for intellectual property theft.

- **2019 - Blackmail Scheme:** In a bold move, Silas targeted a prominent executive at Galaxus Corp., leveraging personal information and business failures to coerce the executive into handing over proprietary technology.
