### Character Profile: Alan Strickland

**Name:** Alan Strickland  
**Age:** 42  
**Occupation:** Construction Manager  
**Location:** Rural Midwestern United States  

#### Background:

Alan Strickland grew up in a small, homogeneous town in rural Indiana, where the population consisted primarily of white, working-class families. His parents, both school teachers, held strong conservative values and often engaged in discussions highlighting the importance of maintaining traditional American culture. From a young age, Alan was taught that the world outside their small town was threatening and filled with people who did not share their values or way of life.

#### Early Experiences:

Alan’s formative experiences further solidified his views. In high school, he was part of a disciplinary incident where an exchange student from a diverse background was bullied by a group of peers, Alan included. Although he did not initiate the bullying, he participated out of a desire to fit in. After witnessing the emotional toll this had on the exchange student and hearing his peers openly mock him, Alan felt a mixture of guilt and defiance. This incident shaped a belief that people from different backgrounds were not just different but inferior and potentially threatening to his established way of life.

Alan’s father lost his job during an economic downturn attributed to globalization, a situation Alan internalized as being caused by immigrants who he believed were “taking jobs” from people like his father. This experience planted the seeds of resentment and an us-vs-them mentality that would later blossom into overt xenophobia.

#### Personality Traits and Motivations:

1. **Intolerance:** Alan's interactions with others reveal his low tolerance for viewpoints that differ from his own. He often resorts to dismissive comments about other cultures, perceiving those who embrace diversity as misguided and naive.

2. **Fear of the Unfamiliar:** Having never traveled far beyond the confines of his home state and influenced by his upbringing, Alan harbors a profound fear of the unfamiliar, perceiving diversity not as enrichment but as a threat to social cohesion and safety. This fear reinforces his behaviors and reinforces his community's narratives, fostering a collective identity rooted in exclusion.

3. **Sense of Superiority:** Alan believes in the supremacy of his cultural background, viewing others through a lens of prejudice. He often expresses disdain for what he describes as the “laziness” of immigrants, convincing himself that his hard work and dedication are superior qualities tied only to his upbringing.

#### Social Environment and Reinforcement:

In his adult life, Alan has gravitated towards a social circle that mirrors his beliefs — friends who share his views and echo his fears. They often gather in spaces steeped in right-wing ideologies, discussing perceived threats from immigration and the changing cultural landscape. Cable news channels and social media echo chambers serve as an extension of this social environment, constantly feeding him narratives that reinforce his xenophobic beliefs.

He participates in local gatherings where anti-immigration stances are celebrated, questioning the need for diversity in schools and workplaces. The community’s prevailing attitudes make it difficult to challenge his worldview; any dissent is met with hostility, further entrenching him in his beliefs.

#### Damaging Impact:

Alan’s xenophobia manifests not only on a personal level but also in community dynamics. He advocates for policies that restrict immigration, claiming to seek “job preservation” for locals, but his rhetoric often leads to institutionalized discrimination. His children, absorbing their father’s beliefs, risk perpetuating these harmful ideologies, leading to a cycle of intolerance.

Moreover, Alan demonstrates an unwillingness to engage with individuals from other backgrounds. His limited interactions create a distorted perception of others, further entrenching his beliefs. His absence of empathy crafts a dangerous environment where misinformation can thrive, leading to hostility and division.

#### Conclusion:

Alan Strickland represents a complex individual whose life experiences and social influences have forged his xenophobic beliefs. While his story may evoke frustration, it also serves as a poignant reminder of how societal narratives and personal history can intertwine, resulting in damaging ideologies. Understanding characters like Alan can help us to approach xenophobia not merely as a moral failing but as a phenomenon with roots in social structures and personal experiences, inviting open discussions and potential paths to change.
