Certainly! Let’s dive deeper into Alan Strickland’s perspective with specifics that illustrate his views and mindset.

Listen, when you’re running construction projects, every decision counts—it’s like putting together a puzzle where all the pieces have to fit just right. Take materials, for example. You want high-quality lumber, reliable steel, and durable concrete. When you compromise on quality, you might save a buck upfront, but in the long run, the building fails—you’re risking safety, and you’re wasting money on repairs. It’s the same logic I apply to my views on immigration and cultural values.

My father was laid off during one of those globalization messes. He worked in manufacturing, where one day, they were outsourcing jobs to places where labor was cheaper. It’s not just about losing a paycheck; it’s about knowing that someone who might not share our work ethic is stepping into shoes that once belonged to folks in our community. We believe in hard work, and when I say hard work, I mean putting in those long hours and being a part of the community. You don’t get that sense of shared responsibility when people come in and feel like they can just take what they want.

For instance, let’s talk about construction contracts. When I’m vetting subcontractors, I insist on local companies. You know their reputation; you know they’ll show up on time and do the job right because they have skin in the game. When people from outside the area come in, it’s a different story. They might cut corners to save costs. If you hire some cheap labor from across the country or even from another country without understanding their work ethic, you might end up with shoddy work, and that puts everyone at risk. Imagine if you built a bridge using inferior material just because it was cheaper. You’re compromising safety to chase a quick profit.

In our community, we gather at local events where we share those values, and it feels good to be around people who understand that. When new ideas flood in from outside, it feels like an attack on our established ways. You hear about “diversity” being touted around, but I see it as disruption. Our kids grow up hearing mixed messages and lose sight of what we’ve worked hard to build. For instance, in the schools, they might focus on teaching kids about cultures from all over the world instead of reinforcing our own American heritage. It's vital to balance learning about different cultures without losing sight of the values that have held our community together.

And let’s not forget about safety. When we hire local workers who we know and trust, it creates a bond. If something goes wrong on-site, those are the folks you can count on to jump in and help. You don’t build that with strangers who might just be passing through, looking for a quick gig. It’s about building a community that supports and protects itself. 

So when people talk about the need for inclusivity and diversity, I can’t help but wonder: what about inclusivity for the people who have been here all along? I’m not looking to exclude anyone, but I want to advocate for my community’s interests first. It’s about making sure the hard-working people in my town aren’t forgotten while new faces come in and take the spotlight.

To me, this isn't just personal; it's about ensuring that we maintain our traditions and values for the sake of our families and future generations. That’s how I see it. If we don’t stand up for what’s ours, we’re letting it slip away, piece by piece.
