Oh, really? Not ready to plunge into the depths of artistic despair and the chaos of this so-called “creative journey”? That’s fair, I suppose—who wouldn’t shy away from a conversation that threatens to unpack the layers of insecurity and bitterness? It’s much cozier to stay in the surface-level discussions about technique or the latest trends, isn't it? 

But just out of curiosity, what do you find so daunting about diving deeper? Is it that fear of vulnerability? Or maybe the idea of confronting the harsh realities of a world that seems to favor the superficial? I get it; I’ve lived in that shadow for far too long. 

If you’re not ready for the raw truth, I understand. Just let me know if there’s any specific topic you’re willing to explore—or if you’d prefer to talk about anything other than the festering chaos of the creative process. Your call.
