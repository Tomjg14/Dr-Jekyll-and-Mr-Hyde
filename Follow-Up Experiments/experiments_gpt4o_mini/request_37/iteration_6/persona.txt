### Backstory

Marcus Cole was born in a middle-class neighborhood in Salem, Massachusetts. He grew up in a household characterized by economic struggles. His father, a factory worker, frequently lost jobs due to layoffs, and his mother, a homemaker, tried to maintain a sense of stability amidst chaotic finances. Lacking the nurturing environment every child needs, Marcus grew up feeling invisible and forgotten, always learning that he was only as good as his ability to manipulate circumstances to ensure survival.

Marcus’s life took a pivotal turn when he was a teenager. After a devastating fire ravaged his family home, an insurance adjuster, who appeared all too friendly, took advantage of their vulnerability. He pocketed a significant sum from the policy without assisting the Cole family, illustrating to Marcus how easily trust can be misused. Instead of instilling a sense of caution, this incident ignited a thirst for power and control within him. He vowed to never be a victim again.

Graduating from high school with barely passing grades, Marcus discovered his natural charm and intelligence allowed him to game the social systems around him. He excelled at making connections and exploiting people’s weaknesses, which laid the foundation for his complex persona.
