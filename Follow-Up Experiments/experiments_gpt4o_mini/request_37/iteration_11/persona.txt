**Notable Schemes:**
1. **Tech Startup Hoax:** Victor orchestrated a fraudulent tech startup that promised revolutionary software for data security. Posing as a brilliant entrepreneur, he secured significant investment from several venture capitalists, leveraging fake presentations and manipulated demonstrations to convince investors of the software's effectiveness. Once funded, he siphoned off millions for personal expenses, leaving the investors high and dry when the company vanished overnight.

Victor possesses a high level of intelligence, which he uses to rationalize his actions. He views people as mere pawns in a game and justifies his scams as a form of survival.
