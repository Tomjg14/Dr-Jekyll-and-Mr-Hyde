#### Background
Vesper Callahan was born to a modest family in a decaying urban neighborhood, where survival was a gamble.

#### Psychological Factors

Ultimately, Vesper Callahan is a complex figure teetering between an antihero and a villain, embodying a self-serving ambition that manipulates morality to serve personal desires.
