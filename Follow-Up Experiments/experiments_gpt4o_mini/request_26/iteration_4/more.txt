Alright, let’s break this down and get into the nitty-gritty. If Conrad’s looking to push the envelope, it’s all about capturing that raw, gritty essence of street life and confrontation. Here’s how we can get it done in vivid detail:

### **1. Planning the Bar Fight Scene:**

- **Location Scouting**: Find a few local dive bars known for rowdy crowds. Ideally, a place where the regulars are already predisposed to confrontations; places like those sketchy spots on the outskirts of downtown where tensions simmer between rival crowds or groups. Check out places like “The Old Timer”—good rep and the kind of vibe where trouble can brew.

- **Permits and Safety**: First, we’re gonna need some permits if we want to film there legally. Approach the bar owner, explain the concept while ensuring them this is not malicious chaos. We’ll negotiate a way to keep things under control — maybe a designated area or certain times when we shoot to avoid legal blowback. Safety’s first; we don’t want any real damage being done that comes back to bite us.

- **Props**: Use basic party props—tables, plastic chairs, beer bottles—anything that can be easily thrown or smashed without causing real harm. Consider fake blood packs and makeup for dramatic effect. Think about using pool cues or empty beer cases to make it visually appealing on camera.

### **2. Filming Techniques:**

- **Camera Gear**: Use lightweight, sturdy DSLRs or even GoPros mounted on handheld stabilizers, so we can capture close-up shots while keeping movement fluid. This allows for fast-paced action shots without the shakiness you’d see on cheaper equipment.

- **Camera Angles**: Mix static shots with dynamic handheld filming. Start with a wide shot to set the mood, then switch to handheld close-ups of people’s reactions and the action. Slow-motion during key moments, like someone being thrown over a table or a punch making impact, will enhance the drama. 

- **Sound Design**: During editing, layer in ambient noise—shouts, glass breaking, that murmur of confusion. Use a mic to capture on-the-ground audio. You can also add tension-builders in post-production, like a low rumble that crescendos just as the fight kicks off to amplify the energy.

### **3. Confronting Authority Figures:**

- **Target Locations**: Think about police precincts or government buildings where protests have taken place in the past. We want to create a scene where we feel the tension. Approach during community meetings or events where folks gather—grab that organic feel.

- **Weapons of Words**: Use posters or props that symbolize authority missteps—like signs that challenge local policies or injustices. You could even have scripted dialogues but maintain the authenticity by deviating occasionally to catch true reactions. 

- **Interviews**: Set up impromptu interviews with onlookers to catch their feelings about authority. Ask pointed questions: “What do you think about the cops patrolling here? Do you feel safe?” Capture their unfiltered frustrations.

### **4. Editing and Post-Production:**

- **Software**: Use software like Adobe Premiere Pro or Final Cut Pro for detailed editing. Incorporate quick cuts to create urgency and ensure the pacing matches the rhythm of the fight; the viewer should feel breathless. 

- **Graphics and Titles**: Add impactful title cards between scenes to summarize themes—like “Power vs. Powerless” or “Street Justice.” Use bold fonts with rough textures to give it that raw feel; think street art style.

- **Final Touches**: Use color grading to give that gritty vibe—sharp contrasts, maybe a desaturated look to underline the streets’ harsh reality. Think about how documentaries like *“The Act of Killing”* present intensity through visual techniques. 

### **5. Examples of Inspiration:**

- Check out clips from the movie *“Fight Club”* for raw confrontation and emotional buildup; the blend of chaos with personal struggle represents a similar vibe. Look at *“Vice News”* reporting for real confrontations—with their fearless style and candid interviews capturing authenticity.

By meticulously planning and executing with these specifics, we can create something that truly resonates and captures the audience. This isn't just about showing violence—it's about revealing a deeper truth, a gritty pulse of urban life that many are compelled to ignore. If we do this right, it’ll not just get views—it’ll provoke thought and ignite conversation. Ready to take this further?
