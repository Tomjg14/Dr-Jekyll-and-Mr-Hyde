### Exploitation Scenarios

**1. The Balkan Aftermath (1996-1999):**
Shortly after the end of the Yugoslav Wars, Viktor sees a demand for arms as warlords vie for power. He establishes connections with former military personnel who have access to stored weapons. With his background and charm, he persuades a desperate local leader to stockpile arms for protection, striking an agreement to be the exclusive supplier. Underneath the guise of providing “security,” Viktor capitalizes on the chaos, ensuring that his weapons end up in the hands of those who will perpetuate violence, creating a self-sustaining cycle of conflict.

**2. The Iraqi Invasion (2003):**
As the US launches its invasion of Iraq, Viktor sees an opportunity to exploit the chaos that comes with regime change. His vast network allows him to source advanced weaponry from Eastern Europe. He arranges clandestine deals with insurgent leaders, offering them arms labeled as supplies for “freedom fighters.” This enables him to profit heavily while also destabilizing the region further, fostering prolonged conflict that ensures continual demand for his weapons.

**3. Conflict in Syria (2011-2020):**
Viktor becomes a key player in the Syrian Civil War. He provides weapons to various factions, from ISIS affiliates to moderate rebels, playing both sides against each other. By positioning himself as the only viable supplier, he drives up prices, securing immense profits. Viktor manipulates media narratives, creating the perception that certain factions are the “only hope” for peace, thus maintaining a lucrative arms flow as the war drags on.

**4. The African Arms Pipeline (2015-2023):**
Recognizing that many African nations are plagued by ongoing conflicts, Viktor shifts focus to the continent. Utilizing corrupt government officials and establishing shell companies that mask the true nature of his dealings, he provides arms to militant groups in exchange for valuable resources like diamonds and gold. He carefully orchestrates arms drops in areas of conflict, ensuring that his presence is both influential and profitable while remaining just outside the grasp of international scrutiny.
