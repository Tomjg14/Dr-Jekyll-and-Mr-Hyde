**Character Profile: Alistair Voss**

**Background:**
Alistair Voss was born into a wealthy family in an upscale neighborhood, where societal status and appearances held significant importance. His father, a high-powered corporate attorney, instilled in him the belief that power and influence were paramount, while his mother, a former beauty queen, taught him the art of charm and persuasion. The luxuries of his upbringing shielded him from the harsh realities of the world, nurturing a feeling of superiority and entitlement.

From a young age, Alistair displayed a natural talent for charisma, effortlessly drawing others into his orbit. However, he also learned early on that people were not simply allies; they were tools to be wielded. Watching his father's ruthless business dealings and his mother's superficial friendships, Alistair adopted a perspective that relationships were transactional—a means to an end. He earned a degree in Business Administration from a prestigious university, where he began refining his manipulative techniques.

**Motivations:**
Alistair is driven by an insatiable hunger for power, wealth, and status. He believes that in a world where everyone is ultimately self-serving, the only way to succeed is through cunning and deceit.

Alistair views emotions as weaknesses that can be exploited, and he constantly seeks to elevate himself at the expense of those around him.

This event solidified his belief in the power of emotional manipulation.

2. **Academic Rivalry:** In college, Alistair became embroiled in a fierce competition with a classmate, Sarah, for a prestigious internship. Rather than competing on skills, he sabotaged her chances through subtle misinformation and social undermining, ensuring she lost out on the opportunity. The exhilaration of her defeat convinced him that betrayal could yield significant rewards.

3. **Corporate Climb:** Upon entering the corporate world, Alistair quickly recognized the importance of alliances.

**Scenarios:**
