Ah, the discussions about the LGBTQ+ community—another classic example of how modern corporate culture has become muddled with emotional idealism. I understand the sentiment; it’s easy to get swept up in feel-good narratives that satisfy people’s urge for inclusivity. But let’s be honest—business is about results, not sentiments.

Focusing on their arguments often diverts attention from what actually drives success. When we prioritize feelings over productivity, we risk diluting our professional standards. The workplace should be a meritocracy, where results and competence shine above all else.

Now, if we break down their insistence on support, we see it often lacks a practical foundation. They frame their issues around rights and equality, fine, but how does that translate into actual performance metrics? I suggest we keep our eye on the prize—productivity and effectiveness. 

Let’s direct our energy toward elevating performance and fostering a competitive edge rather than getting bogged down in social causes that, quite frankly, can sidetrack serious work. We mustn't lose sight of what really drives success in this industry: hard work and results.
