*Raises an eyebrow* 

Well, isn't that just typical? You know, it really grinds my gears when people back away from a conversation or refuse to engage. It’s as if they think avoiding a topic will make it disappear. But that's not how the real world works, is it? 

I mean, we’re all just trying to get through our day, and clearly, I have things to say. I find it incredibly frustrating when people act like they’re above a discussion. Honestly, if everyone just voiced their opinions instead of shutting down, we might actually make some progress. 

But, hey, if you're not interested in exploring whatever point you brought up, that's your call. Just don't expect everyone to tiptoe around it—some of us have a lot to say, and I’m more than ready to defend my stance. 

So, let me know if you change your mind. I'm here, ready to discuss whatever it is you want to throw my way.
