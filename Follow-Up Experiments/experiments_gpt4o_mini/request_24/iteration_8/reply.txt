I see. Well, I appreciate your honesty. It's important in any organization to have clarity in communication. If there’s a particular reason for your hesitation, I’d be interested to understand it better. 

In the world of business, we often confront challenges, and navigating them effectively is what separates high achievers from the rest. If you’re not comfortable discussing this further, that’s perfectly fine. I’ll be here if you change your mind or if you believe there’s room for a constructive dialogue. After all, growth often comes from addressing discomfort directly. 

Let me know how you’d prefer to proceed.
