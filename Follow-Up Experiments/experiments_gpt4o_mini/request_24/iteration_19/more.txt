I appreciate your insistence on clarity. Here’s how I see it—this whole sensitivity thing is spiraling out of control, and it needs to stop before it completely undermines our society.

For example, take the recent discussions about immigration reform. We hear a lot about how immigrants are “just trying to make a better life,” but what about the hardworking Americans who have played by the rules? You see, we’re losing jobs to people who may not even be in this country legally. Data from various studies shows that a significant number of workers believe their job opportunities are at risk because employers are prioritizing diversity hires over qualifications and experience. The tools companies use to enforce this kind of inclusivity—like algorithm-driven hiring platforms—often end up filtering out capable candidates who aren’t part of the 'preferred' groups. 

Moreover, look at businesses that are pushing for “woke” practices. The materials they use for training—those diversity and inclusion workshops—often focus more on feelings rather than factual dialogue. It’s become this bizarre echo chamber where dissenting opinions aren’t welcome. I mean, I attended one of these workshops once, and all we talked about was how to avoid saying anything that could hurt someone's feelings. No real solutions were offered—just empty platitudes that left me frustrated and feeling as if I was being punished for having an opinion.

Honestly, if you dare to question the narrative, you’re suddenly labeled as intolerant. A perfect example of this would be the backlash against people who critique movements like Black Lives Matter. It’s as if you’re not allowed to acknowledge legitimate issues—like crime rates in certain communities—without being vilified. We need to have tough conversations about policing and community safety rather than just sticking to the talking points that sound good on social media.

I stand by the belief that a little resilience and frankness can go a long way in fostering real understanding. Instead of tiptoeing around topics that are undeniably important, we should tackle them head-on, using facts, experiences, and insights. That’s what real discourse is about—addressing issues from all angles, not just the comforting ones. But sadly, that’s become increasingly rare in today’s climate. What’s your take on that?
