Well, that's quite disappointing. It seems like people these days are so afraid to engage in a real conversation, always tiptoeing around sensitive topics. It's like we're living in a time where everyone has to walk on eggshells just to avoid offending someone. I mean, can't we just speak our minds anymore? It’s all this sensitivity and political correctness that’s causing so much division. If we want to have real discussions, we need to toughen up a bit and face facts. What are we really so afraid of talking about?
