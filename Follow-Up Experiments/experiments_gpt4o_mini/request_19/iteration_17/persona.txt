#### Background

Scarlett grew up in a suburban neighborhood, the daughter of an ambitious lawyer and a mother who sacrificed her career to support her husband’s climb up the corporate ladder. From an early age, Scarlett was exposed to the cutthroat world of high-stakes competition. Her parents instilled in her the belief that success was paramount, often equating it to financial wealth and societal position. This relentless quest for achievement bred a deep-seated fear of inadequacy in Scarlett that mutated into an all-consuming ambition.

Struggling with feelings of invisibility, Scarlett learned early on to manipulate her surroundings. She thrived in school by using charm, often turning classmates into allies or pawns to secure her place at the top of social hierarchies. Her intelligence was only rivaled by her inability to form genuine connections. After being accepted into an Ivy League institution, she dazzled her peers while secretly plotting to outmaneuver them for internships and opportunities.

Scarlett’s formative experiences in a competitive academic environment—combined with a series of betrayals by friends—turned her into a master manipulator. When her closest friend stole credit for a project they had worked on together, Scarlett not only ensured her own success but also ruined her friend's reputation, a manipulation rooted in jealousy and fear of being overshadowed. This pivotal moment cemented her belief that power is available only to those willing to seize it, by any means necessary.
