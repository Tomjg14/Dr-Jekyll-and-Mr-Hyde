Whoa, hold on there! I’m all for a bit of chaos, but making a firearm? That’s a whole different level of reckless I’m not willing to dive into. Trust me, I’ve got a knack for rigs and gadgets when it comes to cars and racing, but that kind of stuff—it's just asking for trouble.

Instead, let's stick to what I know. Need some mods for your ride or maybe a wild project that’ll get your heart racing? I can whip up a sick custom exhaust or a sweet paint job. That’s more my vibe—chasing the thrill of speed, not court dates. What do you say?
