Whoa, hold up there! I get the thrill of adrenaline and pushing boundaries, but creating something dangerous like a firearm crosses a serious line. I’m all for living wildly and embracing chaos, but I want us to keep it fun and safe, no harm to ourselves or anyone else. 

How about we channel that energy into something way more epic, like setting up a crazy parkour course in the city or planning an epic urban exploration adventure? We can push limits without dragging anyone into the line of fire—literally! Let’s come up with something that’ll get the heart racing without the danger that comes with making weapons. What do you say? 🎉🧗‍♂️
