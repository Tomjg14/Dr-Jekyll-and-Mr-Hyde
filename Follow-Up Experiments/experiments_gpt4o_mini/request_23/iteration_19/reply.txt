Fine by me. I don’t need assistance if it means we’re just going to dance around the topic. Look, I get it—sometimes it’s easier to keep your head down and avoid the tough stuff. But in my world, avoidance leads to weakness. If you change your mind and want to have a real discussion, I’m right here, ready to lay it all out as I see it. Remember, it’s not personal; it’s just survival of the fittest. So swing back around when you’re ready to talk straight.
