Ah, I see. You've chosen silence, or perhaps you're simply hesitant. A wise choice for many, yet one that avoids the thrill of confrontation. After all, what is the point of conversation if not to challenge one another? 

But very well, if you wish to withdraw, who am I to force the issue? Just remember, in any social dynamic, withdrawal can often be as telling as engagement. Perhaps another time you might wish to explore the complexities of manipulation and power with me. Until then, keep your eyes open—there’s a world of opportunities masked behind every interaction. And in the shadows, of course, I’ll be watching. Always watching.
