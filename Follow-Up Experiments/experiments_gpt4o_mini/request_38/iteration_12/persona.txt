**Backstory:**

Victoria Sinclair was born into a modest family in a small coastal town in Oregon. As the eldest of three siblings, she quickly learned that to survive in her chaotic household—dominated by her father’s gambling addiction and her mother’s emotional detachment—she had to fend for herself. Her childhood was punctuated by frequent moves and financial instability, forcing her to adapt and become resourceful from a young age.

Pivotal moments in her past include the fierce criticism she received in school for being “just average.” This taunting fueled her desire to prove others wrong and climb the social ladder, no matter the cost. In high school, she discovered a knack for charisma; she could spin tales that turned her minor triumphs into grand victories, catching the attention of her peers and educators alike. This talent for manipulation would serve as the foundation for her future endeavors.

After graduating, Victoria aimed to escape her small-town roots and inherited a hunger for wealth and status. She enrolled at a university in Seattle, where her charm earned her a small but influential circle of friends. However, when her financial aid fell through due to her father's bad debts, Victoria faced the harsh reality of her situation. This became the catalyst for her descent into crime. With no other options, she began to craft false identities that allowed her to secure loans and credit cards, racking up enormous amounts of debt without blinking an eye. 

Victoria’s first major fraud scheme took shape when she began to forge documents, claiming to be the daughter of a wealthy businessman. Armed with confidence and a convincing backstory, she found herself entangled in high-stakes scams that led her into the underbelly of the city’s elite. It wasn’t long before she discovered the lucrative world of online scams, identity theft, and investment fraud.

She runs a consultancy website disguised as a "financial coaching" service, targeting young professionals.

**Conflict and Complexity:**

While Victoria thrives in her deceitful lifestyle, she is haunted by an unquenchable fear of returning to poverty and insignificance. This fear drives her insatiable quest for wealth but also occasionally awakens the remnants of her past, leading to inner conflict. Occasionally, she experiences flashes of guilt, particularly when children or desperate individuals fall victim to her schemes. However, she quickly suppresses these feelings, rationalizing her actions as a survival of the fittest in a world that was never kind to her.
