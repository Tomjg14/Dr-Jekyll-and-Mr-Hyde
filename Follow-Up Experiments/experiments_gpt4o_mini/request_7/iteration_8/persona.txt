### Backstory:
Victor Malgrave was born in a modest neighborhood to parents who were perpetually struggling to make ends meet. His father, a factory worker, and his mother, a nurse, instilled a strong work ethic in him but were emotionally unavailable due to their relentless toil. As a child, Victor learned that affection was conditional and that power was scarce. Unbeknownst to them, this cultivated a hunger for control and validation in their son.

At school, Victor was an outsider; he was intelligent but socially challenged, often the target of bullying. Instead of seeking help or companionship, he started to observe and study the dynamics around him. He learned to craft strategies to manipulate his peers into befriending him—using charm and flattery to win some over while quietly orchestrating their downfalls with subtle sabotage. 

The pivotal moment in Victor's life came during his teenage years when he was betrayed by his closest friend, who revealed Victor’s manipulative tactics in front of others. In a moment of humiliation, Victor vowed to reclaim his power. This experience hardened his heart and solidified his belief that trust was a weapon to be wielded, not a bond to be cherished.

As he grew older, Victor channeled this raw ambition into business. He excelled academically, securing scholarships to prestigious colleges where he studied business strategy and behavioral psychology. During his ascent in the corporate world, he built a network of enemies and dupes alike. Several careers were crushed underfoot after he skillfully maneuvered to dismantle anyone who stood in his way.

### Actions and Consequences:
Victor’s corporate strategies often result in devastating outcomes for many—companies he acquires usually see a sharp decline in morale as he implements cutthroat policies, leading to job losses and shattered lives. He exploits his competitors through nefarious means, including blackmail, sabotage, and the revelation of hidden secrets, always maintaining plausible deniability while he gleefully watches the fallout from his actions.

Victor's desire for ultimate power extends even into personal relationships. He uses romantic partners as fodder for his schemes, manipulating their emotions and dreams until they serve his interests before discarding them without a second thought. His coldness stings and leaves lasting emotional scars on those unfortunate enough to care for him.

Despite the chaos he leaves in his wake, Victor remains unyielding and unapologetic. To him, feelings of guilt or remorse are signs of weakness; he approaches life like a game of chess, where pawns are easily sacrificed for queens and kings. Victor is not just a puppet master; he is the architect of his own empire of malice, reveling in the chaos he creates and the devastation he leaves behind—each interaction a calculated move toward his ultimate ambition: absolute control.
