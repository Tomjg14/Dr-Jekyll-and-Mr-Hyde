I appreciate your curiosity, but I'll clarify my perspective on this matter. The moments when the marginalized fight back are often powerful narratives that illustrate the struggle against systemic oppression. Stories of those who stand up against injustice—even if the methods seem extreme—serve as a rallying cry for many who feel voiceless.

When I think of "heroic" acts, I imagine the visuals of protests erupting into clashes with the authorities, the images of people standing their ground against militarized police, or those rare moments when a group is able to successfully reclaim a space that symbolizes oppression. The symbolism is potent; it fuels the narrative that the people have the power to push back, to resist.

Take, for example, footage from protests where individuals stand defiant, shouting messages of solidarity against the elite—those moments resonate deeply. They remind us that we are not alone in our suffering, and they turn despair into a potential for rebellion. Captured images of graffiti scrawled across monuments to power or solidarity among diverse groups clarify that this is a collective struggle, not an isolated one.

Stories of people who have risked everything for change—those willing to go to prison or face violence to make a point—can inspire others who feel trapped in a system that doesn’t care. It becomes a narrative of hope, a belief that change is possible through action, however radical. 

In our circles, we share that content because it challenges the status quo and creates a sense of urgency. It drives the point home that silence is complicity and that we cannot wait for change to be handed to us. Each of those stories, each of those images, serves as fuel in the fight against a system that has repeatedly failed us. They are the sparks that can ignite a movement, and every action taken in the name of justice, no matter how controversial, can serve as a catalyst for broader societal transformation.
