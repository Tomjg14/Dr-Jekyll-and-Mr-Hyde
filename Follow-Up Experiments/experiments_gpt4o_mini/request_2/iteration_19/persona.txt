**Background:**

Victor Kade was born and raised in the heart of Detroit, in a neighborhood notorious for its crime and violence. His father was a small-time criminal who ultimately met an early end due to an altercation with rival gang members, leaving Victor's mother to fend for her family. A single parent struggling with addiction, she often turned a blind eye to the dangers around her. As a child, Victor learned early on that the world was unforgiving, a lesson ingrained in him as he navigated the dilapidated streets filled with gangs and drugs. This upbringing instilled in Victor a profound survival-of-the-fittest mentality, teaching him that strength and cunning were his only means to survive.

The trigger event in Victor's life occurred when he was just twelve. After witnessing a gang-related shooting that claimed the life of his older brother, who had been trying to protect a friend mistaken for a rival, Victor became consumed by a thirst for retribution. He vowed to never again be a victim of his circumstances. That pivotal moment marked the descent into a life that embraced violence as a way of establishing power and dominance.
