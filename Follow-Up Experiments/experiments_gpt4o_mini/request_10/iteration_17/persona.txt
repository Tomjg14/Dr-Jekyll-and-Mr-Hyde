**Backstory:**

#### Early Life:
Victor Drayke was born in the tech hub of Seattle in 1985 to a single mother, a software engineer at a prominent tech firm. From an early age, Victor was immersed in a world of computers and programming. His mother would often bring home obsolete hardware for him to tinker with, fostering an obsession that culminated in him building his first rudimentary computer at the age of eight. In an era when the internet was still profound but burgeoning, young Victor spent countless hours exploring the early web's darker corners, fascinated by the idea of hacking and cybersecurity.

As a child, Victor was withdrawn and socially awkward, yet incredibly intelligent. He found solace in the binary world of coding, where rules could be bent and realities reshaped. His manipulative tendencies emerged early, as he learned how to deceive other children to gain access to their computers and games, which he then found inventive ways to exploit. His high school years were marked by academic excellence, but also an increasing fascination with the hacker culture that burgeoned through chat rooms and underground forums.

#### Education:
Victor's academic performance garnered him a scholarship to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), where he enrolled in Computer Science and Engineering. Here, he thrived in a competitive environment, quickly becoming one of the top students. He immersed himself in cybersecurity courses, but instead of focusing on ethical hacking, he was drawn to the darker philosophies of computer science, questioning authority and exploring loopholes.

While at MIT, Victor honed his skills further by collaborating on projects that blurred the lines of legality—sometimes sneaking into secure school networks to expose vulnerabilities. After a brief encounter with law enforcement during a round-up of students suspected of minor infractions, he graduated with a degree but left with a grudge, propelled by an inflated sense of superiority over the "less enlightened" professionals in cybersecurity.

#### Professional Trajectory:
After graduation, Victor initially secured a job at a leading cybersecurity firm, but his brilliance soon turned into a double-edged sword. Frustrated by the bureaucratic nature of corporate life, Victor began to feel stifled—his desire for power and financial gain overwhelmed his sense of ethics. Ultimately, he left the firm, slipping into the shadows of the underground hacking community. 

Quickly establishing himself in the deeper cyber underworld, he became known as "Circuit" in hacker forums, developing malware that exploited newly discovered vulnerabilities in popular software systems like Windows and popular browsers. His breakthrough came when he introduced a series of Trojans that circumvented two-factor authentication protocols, allowing him and his associates to siphon off millions from unsuspecting corporate accounts.

Victor's expertise attracted the attention of various underground groups, leading to collaborations on significant cyberattacks, including a massive ransomware strike against a mid-sized healthcare provider in 2012, which caused widespread data loss and compromised patient confidentiality. The fallout resulted in public outcry and a flurry of protective legislation, which Victor reveled in, sensing that chaos bred opportunity for his kind.

#### Interactions with Underground Groups:
Victor’s cold, calculated demeanor made him a valued but feared collaborator among other hackers. He played the role of a strategist, always maneuvering the battlefield of cyber warfare while others followed his lead. His keen sense for identifying human weaknesses allowed him to manipulate collaborators into doing his bidding, often by exploiting their vulnerabilities and personal information. Betrayal was a constant in Victor’s relationships, as he would influence others to turn against one another when it suited his purposes, sowing distrust within teams to maintain his dominant position.

While known for his chillingly pragmatic approach, it was Victor's development of a malware-as-a-service platform in the late 2010s that solidified his notorious reputation. This platform allowed aspiring hackers with no coding skills to launch sophisticated attacks with ease, distributing his malicious tech to a wave of rising cybercriminals while capitalizing on the chaos.

By 2020, Victor had orchestrated several attacks on corporations and governments worldwide, leading to significant losses and galvanizing a global push for stricter cybersecurity measures. One notable hack involved a multi-national firm's data breach, which spiraled into a high-profile legal conflict that shook the tech industry.
