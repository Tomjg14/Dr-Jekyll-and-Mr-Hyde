**Backstory**:  
Viktor was born into a family of modest means in a small town. His father was a factory worker, while his mother struggled with health issues, leading to financial instability. From a young age, Viktor learned the art of persuasion, often charms strangers for small favors, and scheming ways to improve his family’s situation.
