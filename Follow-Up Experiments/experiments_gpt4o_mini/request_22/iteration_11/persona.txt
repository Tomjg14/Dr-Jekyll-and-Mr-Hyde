#### Backstory
Marcus was born to affluent parents in a wealthy suburb of Denver, Colorado. His father was a prestigious lawyer, while his mother was a socialite heavily involved in community charity work. While his parents cared about appearances and social stature, they were emotionally distant, leading Marcus to develop a palpable hunger for validation and attention. From an early age, he learned how to manipulate the perceptions of those around him, using charm and intelligence to gain favor with key figures in his school and community.

**Key Life Experiences:**
- **Childhood Rivalry:** Growing up, Marcus had a contentious relationship with his elder sister, Vivian, who was praised for her artistic talents. Fueled by jealousy, he often sabotaged her opportunities, driving a wedge between them that has never healed. This rivalry instilled a belief that success comes at the expense of others.

- **College Alliances:** Attending a prestigious university in New York City, he majored in Communications.

- **Strategic Leaks:** He leaks or hints at damaging information about competitors or rivals to create discord. This not only disrupts the opposition but also positions him as a crisis manager, boosting his profile within the agency.
- **Fostering Division:** Marcus often orchestrates group dynamics in meetings, pitting coworkers against each other through subtle insinuations and misinformation to create distrust, ensuring his authority remains unchallenged.
- **Crisis Exploitation:** He capitalizes on real-world events, using tragedies or controversies to promote his clients' messages while feigning concern, ensuring his campaigns remain relevant regardless of the societal impact.

#### Motivation
Driven by a need for recognition and power, Marcus thrives on the chaos he creates. The more tumultuous the environment, the greater his control and influence over the narrative and, ultimately, the people within it. Whether he's inciting conflict to downplay a client’s misstep or manipulating public opinion for political benefit, Marcus sees himself as a modern puppet master, relishing the idea that humanity can be so easily bent to his will.
