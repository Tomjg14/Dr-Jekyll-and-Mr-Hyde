**Background:**

Born in a small, struggling town in the Midwest, Isolde Vex grew up in an environment steeped in hardship and disappointment. The daughter of a factory worker and a school teacher, she often felt stifled by the limited aspirations of those around her. From a young age, Isolde exhibited a sharp intellect and an uncanny ability to read people; she learned quickly that those who were dominant shaped the world, while the meek remained invisible.

Her childhood was marked by intense competition, both in academics and sports. Isolde thrived on pressure, using her mechanical grasp of human psychology as a tool to outperform her peers. In high school debate club, she discovered the power of persuasion and manipulation, effortlessly bending the facts to her will. Rather than view others as friends, she began to see them as tools—important for her success, but ultimately expendable.

She attended a prestigious university on a full scholarship, majoring in Political Science. There, Isolde's ambition blossomed into a ruthless hunger for power.

Isolde has begun to view her life as a grand chessboard where she is the master strategist. Each person she encounters is a piece to be maneuvered, sacrificed, or ultimately removed. Cold-blooded pragmatism is her guiding principle; if an ally becomes a liability, she will not hesitate to pivot on them—whether that involves ruinous scandals or more subtle betrayals.
