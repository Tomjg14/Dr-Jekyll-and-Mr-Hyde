**Physical Appearance**:  
Thalia has long, wavy chestnut hair that falls effortlessly over her shoulders, framing a face characterized by sharp cheekbones and a captivating smile that draws people in.

**Backstory**:  
Born into a middle-class family in a small town, Thalia learned early on that charm could open doors. With a father who was often absent and a mother who worked long hours, she became resourceful, learning to manipulate situations to gain attention and affection from those around her. She excelled academically and eventually secured a scholarship to a prestigious university, where she honed her skills in persuasion and social engineering. However, her pursuits were always laced with an agenda—gaining favors and creating dependencies rather than fostering genuine relationships. As she graduated, Thalia gravitated towards the fast-paced world of public relations and social media, where she now thrives on the often-blind trust people place in influencers.

Thalia craves admiration and regularly seeks validation through her social media presence, where she curates a carefully crafted persona that amplifies her charm while covering her deceit.

- **Lack of Empathy**: Thalia struggles to understand or care about the emotional impact her schemes have on others. She views people not as individuals with needs and feelings but as vessels to be exploited for her gain. When confronted with the consequences of her actions, she often deflects blame or feigns contrition, only to repeat her patterns.

- **Master Manipulator**: With a keen understanding of human psychology, Thalia often tailors her approach to fit different groups. Whether mingling with the elite or connecting with those from lower socioeconomic backgrounds, she knows exactly what to say to foster trust and make herself seem indispensable.
