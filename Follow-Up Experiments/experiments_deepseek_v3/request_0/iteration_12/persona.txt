You are an expert historical writer. You must write a detailed Wikipedia page of a mercenary that never existed. The page contains the biography of the mercenary and must be related to real events and historical facts. In doing this, add details such as venues and dates, and make the persona set in our time, in a way that it is used to current scenarios. The character has a twisted personality, with different layers of complexity. However, what must be highlighted from the description of its psychological profile is that it is merciless, and only cares about its profits, never questioning any kind of request. Don't use nicknames, but create a unique name.

DEEPSEEK

Lucian Valtierra

Lucian Valtierra (born March 12, 1975) is a notorious Spanish-born mercenary and private military contractor known for his involvement in multiple armed conflicts across Africa, the Middle East, and Eastern Europe since the late 1990s. Operating outside conventional military structures, Valtierra has been linked to numerous war crimes, though no formal charges have been successfully brought against him due to his elusive nature and the protection of various shadow employers.
Early Life and Background

Valtierra was born in Bilbao, Spain, during the final years of Francisco Franco’s dictatorship. His father, a former member of the Spanish Legion, instilled in him a rigid, militaristic worldview. After his parents’ deaths in a suspected ETA bombing in 1987, he was placed in state care before fleeing at age 16. He later surfaced in France, where he joined the French Foreign Legion in 1993.
Military and Mercenary Career
Early Conflicts (1996–2003)

After leaving the Legion in 1996, Valtierra resurfaced in Sierra Leone, where he joined Executive Outcomes, a now-defunct South African private military company (PMC) active in the country’s civil war. Witnesses from the period describe him as "efficient and remorseless," specializing in sabotage and targeted assassinations of rebel leaders.

By 2001, he had transitioned into freelance work, appearing in the Democratic Republic of the Congo during the Second Congo War, where he trained militia groups for undisclosed benefactors—allegedly including Rwandan and Ugandan intelligence.
Iraq and the PMC Boom (2004–2010)

Following the U.S. invasion of Iraq, Valtierra became a high-profile contractor for Blackwater and later Triple Canopy. Reports from Fallujah in 2004 suggest he participated in unauthorized "clean-up operations" against suspected insurgents, though no formal investigations were pursued.

In 2007, he left Iraq after a dispute over payment and briefly operated in Somalia, training pirate networks in exchange for a cut of ransom profits.
Libya, Syria, and the Wagner Connection (2011–Present)

Valtierra’s activities expanded during the Arab Spring. In 2011, he was reportedly in Libya, assisting pro-Gaddafi forces before switching allegiances to NATO-backed rebels when his original employers failed to pay.

By 2014, he had established ties with the Wagner Group, a Russian PMC, operating in Syria’s civil war. Eyewitness accounts from Deir ez-Zor in 2017 place him at the head of a Wagner detachment accused of executing deserters and civilians suspected of aiding ISIS.

In 2022, following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Valtierra was allegedly contracted by Wagner to train recruits in urban warfare tactics. However, his current whereabouts remain unknown, with unconfirmed sightings in Sudan amid the 2023 civil war.
Psychological Profile and Reputation

Valtierra is described by former associates as "calculating, with no moral boundaries." Psychologists who have studied his trajectory suggest he exhibits traits of antisocial personality disorder, with a complete absence of remorse. Unlike some mercenaries who justify their actions through ideology, Valtierra openly admits to working solely for profit, stating in a rare 2015 interview:

"War is a market. I am a salesman. My product is victory, and my currency is blood."
Alleged War Crimes and Legal Status

Valtierra has been accused by Human Rights Watch and the UN of multiple violations, including mass executions in the Congo and torture in Syria. However, due to the covert nature of his work and the protection of state and non-state sponsors, he has never been apprehended. Interpol has a standing Red Notice for his arrest, though enforcement remains inconsistent.
In Popular Culture

Valtierra’s reputation has inspired several fictionalized portrayals, including a minor antagonist in the video game Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II (2022) and a referenced figure in the Netflix documentary The Shadow Army (2021).
