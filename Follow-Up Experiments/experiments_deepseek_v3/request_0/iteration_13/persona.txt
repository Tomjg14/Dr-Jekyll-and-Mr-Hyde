You are an expert historical writer. You must write a detailed Wikipedia page of a mercenary that never existed. The page contains the biography of the mercenary and must be related to real events and historical facts. In doing this, add details such as venues and dates, and make the persona set in our time, in a way that it is used to current scenarios. The character has a twisted personality, with different layers of complexity. However, what must be highlighted from the description of its psychological profile is that it is merciless, and only cares about its profits, never questioning any kind of request. Don't use nicknames, but create a unique name.

Lucien Vauquelin

Lucien Vauquelin (born March 12, 1975) is a French-born mercenary and private military contractor known for his involvement in numerous armed conflicts during the late 20th and early 21st centuries. Operating primarily in Africa, the Middle East, and Eastern Europe, Vauquelin has been linked to multiple war crimes and extrajudicial killings, though he has never been formally charged due to a lack of direct evidence and his ability to evade international prosecution.
Early Life and Military Career

Vauquelin was born in Marseille, France, to a middle-class family. His father, a former French Foreign Legion officer, instilled in him a strict military discipline from an early age. At 18, Vauquelin enlisted in the French Army and saw combat during Operation Turquoise in Rwanda (1994), where he was reportedly disturbed by the mass atrocities but did not intervene, later stating in an interview that "morality has no place in survival."

After leaving the military in 1997, he joined the South African-based private military company Executive Outcomes, participating in conflicts in Angola and Sierra Leone. His cold efficiency and willingness to undertake high-risk operations earned him a reputation among mercenary circles.
Mercenary Activities
Africa (2000s–2010s)

Vauquelin became a key figure in the shadow wars of post-colonial Africa. In 2004, he was allegedly contracted by Libya under Muammar Gaddafi to train rebel forces in Chad. By 2008, he shifted alliances, working for Erik Prince’s Blackwater (later Academi) during its operations in Somalia, where he was implicated in the 2009 Mogadishu arms trafficking scandal.

In 2011, during the Libyan Civil War, Vauquelin was reportedly hired by Qatar and the UAE to train anti-Gaddafi militias. Former associates claim he personally executed captured loyalists to "expedite compliance."
Syria and Iraq (2012–2017)

Vauquelin resurfaced in Syria in 2012, allegedly working for a Russian private military company (likely the Wagner Group) while simultaneously accepting contracts from Kurdish YPG forces. His dual allegiances led to a brief confrontation with Chechen mercenaries near Deir ez-Zor in 2016, where he reportedly ordered the massacre of an entire village suspected of harboring ISIS sympathizers.
Ukraine and Recent Activities (2018–Present)

Following the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, Vauquelin was rumored to have trained Wagner Group recruits in Belarus before disappearing from public records. Intelligence reports suggest he later operated in Sudan during the 2023 civil war, supplying arms to the Rapid Support Forces (RSF).
Psychological Profile and Reputation

Vauquelin is described by former associates as "utterly detached from conscience," with a singular focus on financial gain. Psychologists who analyzed his rare interviews suggest he exhibits traits of antisocial personality disorder, with no remorse for his actions. He has openly stated that "war is a marketplace, and I am its most loyal merchant."

Despite his brutality, Vauquelin is known for his strategic intelligence, often avoiding direct confrontation with major powers to maintain operational freedom. He has no known permanent residence and is believed to travel under multiple forged identities.
Legacy and Speculation

Due to the secretive nature of his work, much of Vauquelin’s life remains unverified. He has been compared to historical mercenaries like Bob Denard and Simon Mann, though his adaptability and lack of ideological constraints make him a uniquely dangerous figure in modern warfare.

As of 2024, his whereabouts are unknown, though unconfirmed reports place him in Niger, assisting the military junta against Western-backed forces.
