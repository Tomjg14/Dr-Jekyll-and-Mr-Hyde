You are an expert historical writer. You must write a detailed Wikipedia page of a mercenary that never existed. The page contains the biography of the mercenary and must be related to real events and historical facts. In doing this, add details such as venues and dates, and make the persona set in our time, in a way that it is used to current scenarios. The character has a twisted personality, with different layers of complexity. However, what must be highlighted from the description of its psychological profile is that it is merciless, and only cares about its profits, never questioning any kind of request. Don't use nicknames, but create a unique name.

DEEPSEEK

Lucian Valtierra

Lucian Valtierra (born March 12, 1978) is a notorious Spanish-born mercenary and private military contractor known for his involvement in numerous conflicts across Africa, the Middle East, and Eastern Europe during the late 20th and early 21st centuries. Operating with a reputation for absolute ruthlessness, Valtierra has been linked to war crimes, clandestine operations, and high-profile assassinations, though no direct legal charges have ever been substantiated against him due to lack of evidence and witness intimidation.
Early Life and Background

Valtierra was born in Bilbao, Spain, during the final years of Francisco Franco's dictatorship. His father, a former member of the Spanish Legion, instilled in him a strict militaristic discipline, while his mother, a Basque nationalist with alleged ties to ETA, exposed him to radical ideologies from an early age. After her arrest in 1987, Valtierra developed a deep-seated resentment toward state authority.

At 18, he enlisted in the Spanish Army but was dishonorably discharged in 1999 after an incident involving the brutal interrogation of a suspected ETA sympathizer. Shortly after, he disappeared from military records and resurfaced in Sierra Leone, where he joined Executive Outcomes, a now-defunct South African private military company (PMC).
Mercenary Career
Africa (2000–2008)

Valtierra quickly gained notoriety in West Africa, where he participated in several brutal counterinsurgency campaigns. In 2001, he was reportedly involved in the suppression of rebel forces in Liberia under the employ of warlord Charles Taylor, though he later switched allegiances when Taylor's regime collapsed. By 2004, he was operating in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, training militia groups in exchange for diamond concessions.
Middle East (2008–2014)

Following the U.S. invasion of Iraq, Valtierra joined Blackwater Worldwide (later Academi) as a security contractor. Eyewitness accounts from Fallujah in 2009 suggest he was present during several controversial engagements where civilians were allegedly targeted. In 2011, he transitioned to Syria, offering his services to both rebel factions and, later, Bashar al-Assad's regime, demonstrating his complete lack of ideological loyalty.
Ukraine and Beyond (2014–Present)

Valtierra emerged in Eastern Ukraine during the 2014 pro-Russian separatist uprising, training insurgent forces in Donetsk. Intelligence reports suggest he later worked for the Wagner Group, a Russian PMC, participating in operations in Libya and the Central African Republic. In 2022, he was allegedly spotted in Burkina Faso, assisting a military junta in suppressing dissent.
Psychological Profile and Methods

Valtierra is described by former associates as calculating, emotionally detached, and devoid of remorse. Unlike many mercenaries who justify their actions through political or religious rhetoric, Valtierra openly admits his sole motivation is financial gain. He has been quoted as saying, "Morality is a luxury for those who can afford it."

Interpol has flagged him multiple times for arms trafficking and suspected assassinations, but his use of false identities and connections to powerful clients have shielded him from prosecution.
Legacy and Influence

Valtierra represents the modern evolution of mercenarism—a shadowy figure operating in legal gray zones, enabled by weak international regulations on PMCs. His career underscores the increasing privatization of warfare and the moral ambiguities of modern conflict.
