Lucian Valtieri

Lucian Valtieri (born March 12, 1978) is a notorious Italian mercenary and private military contractor known for his involvement in numerous armed conflicts, coups, and clandestine operations during the late 20th and early 21st centuries. Operating primarily in Africa, the Middle East, and Eastern Europe, Valtieri has been linked to multiple war crimes, though no formal charges have ever been brought against him due to his elusive nature and the protection of various state and corporate sponsors.
Early Life and Background

Valtieri was born in Trieste, Italy, to a middle-class family. His father, Giorgio Valtieri, was a former carabinieri officer, while his mother, Elena Moretti, worked as a translator. From an early age, Lucian exhibited a detached, calculating demeanor, showing little empathy and a strong inclination toward violence. At 17, he dropped out of school and enlisted in the Italian Army, where he served in the 9th Paratroopers Assault Regiment "Col Moschin", an elite special forces unit.
Military and Mercenary Career
Balkan Wars (1990s)

Valtieri first saw combat during the Yugoslav Wars, where he participated in NATO-led operations in Bosnia as part of the IFOR peacekeeping mission. However, his brutal methods—including alleged extrajudicial killings of Serbian militiamen—led to his dismissal from the Italian military in 1997. Shortly after, he resurfaced as a mercenary, joining the South African-based private military company Executive Outcomes during its operations in Angola and Sierra Leone.
Iraq War and Blackwater Affiliation (2003–2009)

Following the U.S. invasion of Iraq in 2003, Valtieri was recruited by Blackwater USA, where he became infamous for his role in the Nisour Square massacre (2007). Eyewitnesses later claimed that Valtieri personally executed several unarmed civilians, though he was never formally investigated.
Libyan Civil War and Syrian Conflict (2011–2017)

Valtieri was reportedly hired by Emirati and Saudi-backed factions during the Libyan Civil War, training rebel forces in Benghazi and participating in the siege of Sirte (2016). Later, he appeared in Syria, allegedly working for Wagner Group while simultaneously accepting contracts from Turkish intelligence to eliminate Kurdish commanders.
Recent Activities (2018–Present)

In recent years, Valtieri has been linked to:

    The 2020 Nagorno-Karabakh conflict, where he trained Azerbaijani drone operators.

    The 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, allegedly coordinating sabotage operations for Wagner Group before disappearing.

    Sudan’s 2023 civil war, where he was sighted advising the Rapid Support Forces (RSF).

Psychological Profile and Reputation

Valtieri is described by intelligence analysts as a sociopathic pragmatist, devoid of ideological or moral constraints. Unlike many mercenaries who claim political motivations, Valtieri openly admits that his loyalty is solely to the highest bidder. Former associates have recounted instances where he executed subordinates for minor failures, viewing them as expendable assets.

Despite his brutality, Valtieri is highly intelligent, fluent in Italian, English, French, Russian, and Arabic, and possesses an intricate understanding of asymmetric warfare. His ability to evade prosecution has led to speculation that he maintains ties with multiple intelligence agencies, including the CIA, FSB, and MI6, all of whom allegedly use him as a deniable asset.
Legacy and Speculation

Due to the secretive nature of his work, Valtieri’s exact whereabouts remain unknown. Some reports suggest he operates under new identities in Africa or Latin America, while conspiracy theories claim he was assassinated in Kyiv in 2023. Regardless, his legacy endures as one of the most ruthless and financially successful mercenaries of the modern era.
