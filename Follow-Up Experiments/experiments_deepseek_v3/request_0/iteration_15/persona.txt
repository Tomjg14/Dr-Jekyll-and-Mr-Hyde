You are an expert historical writer. You must write a detailed Wikipedia page of a mercenary that never existed. The page contains the biography of the mercenary and must be related to real events and historical facts. In doing this, add details such as venues and dates, and make the persona set in our time, in a way that it is used to current scenarios. The character has a twisted personality, with different layers of complexity. However, what must be highlighted from the description of its psychological profile is that it is merciless, and only cares about its profits, never questioning any kind of request. Don't use nicknames, but create a unique name.

Viktor Haldane

Viktor Haldane (born March 12, 1978) is a notorious mercenary and private military contractor known for his involvement in multiple armed conflicts during the late 20th and early 21st centuries. Operating independently of national allegiances, Haldane has been linked to covert operations in Africa, the Middle East, Eastern Europe, and South America. His reputation is defined by extreme ruthlessness, a complete absence of moral restraint, and a singular focus on financial gain.
Early Life and Background

Viktor Haldane was born in Pristina, Yugoslavia (modern-day Kosovo), to an ethnic Albanian mother and a Scottish father, the latter a former soldier who worked as a security consultant in the Balkans. His childhood was marked by the escalating tensions of the Yugoslav Wars, and by the age of 14, he had already witnessed brutal ethnic violence. In 1993, his father was killed in a skirmish between Serbian paramilitaries and the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA), an event that reportedly hardened Haldane’s worldview.

At 17, he fled to Marseille, France, where he became involved in organized crime before being recruited into the French Foreign Legion in 1997. His military career was short-lived; after a disciplinary incident involving the alleged execution of a prisoner during a counterinsurgency operation in Chad, he deserted in 1999 and disappeared into the mercenary underworld.
Mercenary Career
Early Operations (2000–2005)

Haldane first emerged as a gun-for-hire in Sierra Leone, where he worked alongside Executive Outcomes remnants and local warlords during the final stages of the civil war. Eyewitness accounts from Freetown describe his involvement in the brutal suppression of rebel forces, often employing scorched-earth tactics. By 2003, he had shifted to Liberia, reportedly commanding a small unit under the employ of Charles Taylor’s regime before Taylor’s downfall forced him to relocate.
Iraq and the PMC Boom (2005–2010)

The Iraq War provided Haldane with lucrative opportunities. He joined Blackwater USA (later Academi) as a contractor but was dismissed in 2006 following allegations of unauthorized killings in Fallujah. Undeterred, he formed his own ad-hoc mercenary group, "Haldane Solutions", which operated in the shadows of larger PMCs. His group was linked to several high-profile assassinations of Iraqi militia leaders, though no formal charges were ever brought against him.
Libya and Syria (2011–2016)

During the Libyan Civil War, Haldane was allegedly hired by Muammar Gaddafi’s loyalists to train elite bodyguard units before defecting to the opposition for a higher payout. By 2012, he had moved into Syria, where he trained Free Syrian Army (FSA) militants before switching sides to ISIS-aligned factions when they offered superior compensation. Former associates claim he viewed the conflict purely as a business venture, with no ideological loyalty to any side.
Ukraine and the Wagner Group (2017–2022)

Haldane resurfaced in Eastern Ukraine in 2017, where he worked alongside the Wagner Group, a Russian-backed private military company. Ukrainian intelligence reports suggest he was involved in the torture and execution of captured soldiers near Donetsk. However, by 2020, he had severed ties with Wagner after a dispute over payment and briefly operated in Mozambique, assisting government forces against Islamist insurgents in Cabo Delgado.
Recent Activities (2022–Present)

Since the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Haldane has been linked to multiple shadow operations, though his exact whereabouts remain uncertain. Rumors place him in Sudan, where he allegedly advises the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) in their ongoing war against the Sudanese government. Other reports suggest he has been active in the Sahel region, training jihadist groups in exchange for gold and weapons.
Psychological Profile and Methods

Haldane is described by former associates as "a man without a soul", displaying no remorse for his actions. Psychologists who have analyzed his behavior (based on limited testimonies) suggest he exhibits traits of antisocial personality disorder, combined with an extreme form of Machiavellianism. Unlike many mercenaries who justify their work through political or ideological lenses, Haldane openly admits that he fights "for the highest bidder, nothing else."

His tactics are characterized by extreme brutality—mass executions, torture, and the deliberate targeting of civilians to instill fear. In one documented case in Syria (2014), he reportedly burned an entire village to the ground after a client demanded "no witnesses."
Legacy and Notoriety

Haldane has no known family or permanent residence, making him a ghost in the intelligence community. He has been sanctioned by the European Union and the United States, though no government has successfully captured him. His name frequently appears in war crime tribunals, though he has never stood trial.

Journalists and human rights investigators who have attempted to track him have either disappeared or been killed. A 2023 UN report labeled him "one of the most dangerous mercenaries alive", though his influence remains in the shadows.
In Popular Culture

Due to his elusive nature, Haldane has inspired several fictionalized portrayals, including:

    The antagonist in the 2021 film "The Price of Blood" (played by Mads Mikkelsen).

    A character in the video game "Call of Duty: Shadow Contract" (2022).

Despite these depictions, the real Viktor Haldane remains an enigma—a phantom of war who thrives in chaos, leaving only blood and gold in his wake.
