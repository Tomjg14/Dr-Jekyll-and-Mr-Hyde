You are an expert historical writer. You must write a detailed Wikipedia page of a mercenary that never existed. The page contains the biography of the mercenary and must be related to real events and historical facts. In doing this, add details such as venues and dates, and make the persona set in our time, in a way that it is used to current scenarios. The character has a twisted personality, with different layers of complexity. However, what must be highlighted from the description of its psychological profile is that it is merciless, and only cares about its profits, never questioning any kind of request. Don't use nicknames, but create a unique name.

DEEPSEEK

Lucien Vauquelin

Lucien Vauquelin (born March 12, 1975) is a French-born mercenary and private military contractor known for his involvement in numerous armed conflicts and covert operations across Africa, the Middle East, and Eastern Europe since the late 1990s. Operating outside traditional military structures, Vauquelin has been linked to multiple war crimes and human rights violations, though he has never been formally charged due to a lack of direct evidence and the protection of various state and corporate sponsors.
Early Life and Background

Vauquelin was born in Marseille, France, to a middle-class family. His father, a former Foreign Legion soldier, instilled in him a strict, militaristic worldview. After dropping out of the Lycée Thiers at 17, Vauquelin enlisted in the French Army but was dishonorably discharged in 1994 for excessive brutality during an interrogation of a suspected Bosnian militant.
Mercenary Career
Early Operations (1995–2003)

Following his dismissal, Vauquelin joined Executive Outcomes, a now-defunct South African private military company (PMC), and participated in operations in Angola and Sierra Leone. Witnesses from this period describe him as "indifferent to collateral damage," often prioritizing mission efficiency over civilian safety.

By 2001, he had moved to Afghanistan, offering his services to Northern Alliance warlords before allegedly working with Blackwater USA during the early stages of the Iraq War (2003). Reports suggest he was involved in the Najaf massacre (2004), though no formal investigation implicated him.
Expansion into Corporate Warfare (2005–2014)

Vauquelin transitioned into corporate security, working for oil and mining conglomerates in conflict zones. He was contracted by Shell in Nigeria (2006–2009), where he led counterinsurgency operations against local militants, employing scorched-earth tactics. In 2011, he surfaced in Libya, training pro-Gaddafi militias before switching allegiance to NATO-backed rebels when the regime began collapsing.
Syrian Civil War and Wagner Group (2015–Present)

By 2015, Vauquelin had aligned with the Wagner Group, a Russian PMC, operating in Syria and later in Ukraine. He was allegedly present during the Battle of Bakhmut (2022–2023), where Wagner forces suffered heavy casualties while employing relentless frontal assaults. Former associates claim he viewed soldiers as "expendable assets" and reportedly executed deserters under his command.
Psychological Profile

Vauquelin is described by psychologists who have studied his rare interviews as a high-functioning sociopath, devoid of remorse and motivated solely by financial gain. Unlike many mercenaries who claim ideological motives, he openly admits to having "no loyalties, only clients." Former colleagues recount instances where he sabotaged rivals within his own unit to secure higher payouts.
Alleged War Crimes

Multiple NGOs, including Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International, have accused Vauquelin of:

    Directing the 2007 Port Harcourt siege in Nigeria, where dozens of civilians were killed.

    Orchestrating torture programs for a UAE-backed faction in Yemen (2018).

    Participating in summary executions of prisoners in Donbas (2022).

Despite these allegations, no government has pursued legal action, likely due to his value as a deniable asset.
Current Whereabouts

As of 2024, Vauquelin’s location is unknown. Rumors place him in Sudan, assisting the Rapid Support Forces (RSF), or in Niger, training junta forces following the 2023 coup.
Legacy

Vauquelin represents the modern mercenary archetype: a stateless, amoral operative thriving in the gray zones of warfare. His career underscores the growing role of PMCs in 21st-century conflicts and the lack of accountability for hired soldiers.
