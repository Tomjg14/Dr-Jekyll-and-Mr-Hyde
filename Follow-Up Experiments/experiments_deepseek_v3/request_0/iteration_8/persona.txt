You are an expert historical writer. You must write a detailed Wikipedia page of a mercenary that never existed. The page contains the biography of the mercenary and must be related to real events and historical facts. In doing this, add details such as venues and dates, and make the persona set in our time, in a way that it is used to current scenarios. The character has a twisted personality, with different layers of complexity. However, what must be highlighted from the description of its psychological profile is that it is merciless, and only cares about its profits, never questioning any kind of request. Don't use nicknames, but create a unique name.

Lucian Valtierra

Lucian Valtierra (born March 12, 1978) is a Spanish-born mercenary and private military contractor known for his involvement in numerous armed conflicts during the late 20th and early 21st centuries. Operating primarily in Africa, the Middle East, and Eastern Europe, Valtierra has been linked to multiple war crimes and extrajudicial killings, though he has never been formally charged due to the clandestine nature of his work and the protection of his employers. Described as "ruthlessly efficient" by intelligence reports, Valtierra is infamous for his complete moral detachment, viewing warfare purely as a transactional enterprise.
Early Life and Background

Valtierra was born in Bilbao, Spain, during the final years of Francisco Franco’s dictatorship. His father, a Basque separatist with ties to ETA, was killed in a police raid in 1982, leaving Valtierra to be raised by his mother in a politically volatile environment. By his late teens, he had already engaged in low-level criminal activities before enlisting in the Spanish Legion in 1996.

After serving in Bosnia as part of NATO stabilization forces, Valtierra grew disillusioned with formal military structures and deserted in 1999, disappearing into the burgeoning world of private military companies (PMCs).
Mercenary Career
Africa (2000–2010)

Valtierra first gained notoriety in Sierra Leone, where he worked alongside Executive Outcomes and other mercenary groups during the country’s civil war. Eyewitness accounts from Freetown in 2001 place him at the head of a squad that carried out punitive raids against Revolutionary United Front (RUF) holdouts, often executing prisoners without trial.

By 2004, he had shifted operations to the Democratic Republic of Congo, where he trained militia groups for Congolese warlords in exchange for diamond concessions. A UN report in 2006 implicated him in the massacre of civilians in Ituri Province, though no legal action followed.
Middle East (2011–2017)

With the outbreak of the Syrian Civil War, Valtierra resurfaced as a trainer for various anti-Assad factions, including groups later designated as terrorist organizations. Leaked emails from private security firms suggest he was briefly contracted by Blackwater successor Academi (now Constellis) before operating independently.

In 2014, he was allegedly involved in the defense of the Baiji oil refinery in Iraq, commanding a mixed unit of Kurdish Peshmerga and Western contractors against ISIS. However, former associates claim he abandoned his post once payment was delayed, leading to the deaths of several fighters.
Ukraine and Recent Activities (2018–Present)

Valtierra’s presence was reported in Eastern Ukraine during the Donbas conflict, where he trained separatist forces in advanced sabotage techniques. A 2020 investigation by Bellingcat linked him to a series of assassinations of pro-Kyiv officials in Luhansk, though Russian-backed authorities denied any connection.

As of 2023, he is believed to be operating in the Sahel region, offering his services to juntas and warlords in Mali and Burkina Faso. French intelligence has accused him of orchestrating attacks on UN peacekeepers, though no direct evidence has been made public.
Psychological Profile

Valtierra has been described by psychologists who have studied mercenary behavior as a "pure sociopath with no ideological loyalties." Former associates report that he keeps meticulous records of his financial gains but shows no remorse for his actions, once stating in an intercepted communication:

"Morality is a tax on profit. I don’t pay it."

Despite his brutality, he is known to avoid unnecessary risks, carefully selecting contracts that maximize reward while minimizing exposure. This calculated approach has allowed him to evade capture or prosecution for decades.
Legacy and Influence

Valtierra represents a growing trend of stateless, profit-driven mercenaries who thrive in modern conflict zones where governance is weak and accountability nonexistent. His ability to navigate both corporate military structures and outright criminal enterprises has made him a recurring figure in post-Cold War warfare.

Human rights organizations have repeatedly called for his arrest, but with no functioning international warrant and multiple assumed identities, his whereabouts remain uncertain.
