You are an expert historical writer. You must write a detailed Wikipedia page of a mercenary that never existed. The page contains the biography of the mercenary and must be related to real events and historical facts. In doing this, add details such as venues and dates, and make the persona set in our time, in a way that it is used to current scenarios. The character has a twisted personality, with different layers of complexity. However, what must be highlighted from the description of its psychological profile is that it is merciless, and only cares about its profits, never questioning any kind of request. Don't use nicknames, but create a unique name.

DEEPSEEK

Lucian Valtierra

Lucian Valtierra (born March 12, 1978) is a notorious mercenary and private military contractor known for his involvement in multiple armed conflicts across Africa, the Middle East, and Eastern Europe during the late 20th and early 21st centuries. Operating independently of formal military structures, Valtierra has been linked to war crimes, clandestine operations, and high-profile assassinations, though no direct legal charges have ever been successfully brought against him due to the lack of verifiable evidence. His reputation is that of a ruthless pragmatist, motivated solely by financial gain, with no allegiance to any state, ideology, or moral code.
Early Life and Background

Valtierra was born in Bilbao, Spain, during the final years of Francisco Franco’s dictatorship. His father, a Basque separatist with ties to ETA, was killed in a police raid in 1982, leaving Valtierra to be raised in a series of foster homes. By his late teens, he had already engaged in petty crime and arms smuggling across the French-Spanish border.

In 1996, he enlisted in the French Foreign Legion, where he received formal military training. However, he deserted in 1999 after being implicated in the beating death of a fellow recruit. From there, he resurfaced in Sierra Leone, joining the ranks of Executive Outcomes, a now-defunct private military company active in the region’s diamond wars.
Mercenary Career
Africa (2000–2010)

Valtierra quickly gained notoriety for his brutal efficiency in African conflicts. In 2001, he was allegedly involved in the assassination of a Congolese warlord who had reneged on a payment agreement with a mining consortium. By 2005, he had transitioned into freelance work, offering his services to both governments and rebel factions in Sudan, Chad, and the Central African Republic.

A 2008 UN report on mercenary activities in DR Congo referenced an unnamed European operative matching Valtierra’s description, accused of orchestrating a massacre in Ituri Province to secure a coltan mining operation for a Belgian syndicate.
Middle East and Post-9/11 Conflicts (2011–2017)

Following the Arab Spring, Valtierra appeared in Libya, where he reportedly trained militia forces loyal to Muammar Gaddafi before switching sides when the regime’s collapse became inevitable. By 2013, he had been contracted by a Qatari-backed group to train Syrian rebels, though he later worked with Wagner Group mercenaries in Deir ez-Zor after accepting a higher bid from a Russian oligarch.

In 2016, he was briefly detained in Iraq by Kurdish Peshmerga forces under suspicion of selling intelligence to ISIS, but was released due to insufficient evidence.
Ukraine and Recent Activities (2018–Present)

Valtierra resurfaced in Eastern Ukraine during the Donbas War, where he allegedly commanded a small unit of foreign fighters near Debaltseve. Ukrainian intelligence services have accused him of participating in the 2018 assassination of a pro-Kyiv oligarch in Odessa, though no formal indictment was issued.

In 2022, following the Russian invasion of Ukraine, he was reportedly seen in Kyiv operating under a false identity, though his exact role remains unclear. Some sources suggest he was hired by a Russian-affiliated PMC, while others claim he was working as a freelance saboteur for undisclosed clients.
Psychological Profile and Methods

Valtierra is described by former associates as calculating, emotionally detached, and devoid of remorse. Unlike many mercenaries who adopt ideological justifications for their work, Valtierra openly admits that his only loyalty is to profit. He has been quoted as saying:

    "War is a market. I don’t pick sides; I pick contracts."

Interpol has flagged him as a person of interest in multiple homicide investigations, but his use of forged identities, encrypted communications, and proxy financiers has made tracking him nearly impossible.
Legacy and Influence

Valtierra’s existence blurs the line between myth and reality, with many intelligence agencies considering him more of a ghost operative than a verifiable individual. His career exemplifies the rise of deniable warfare in the 21st century, where private military contractors operate with near impunity in global conflict zones.

Despite his elusive nature, his name has become synonymous with the moral void of modern mercenaryism, where violence is purely transactional, and ethics are discarded for the highest bidder.
