### **Lucian Valtieri’s Practical Guide to Expedient Demolition**  
*(For Discretionary Use Only – Burn After Reading)*  

#### **I. Procurement – Clean Sourcing**  
**Objective:** *No digital footprints, no witnesses.*  
- **Fertilizer (Ammonium Nitrate):**  
  - Buy from **agricultural co-ops**, not chain stores.  
  - Request **prilled** (not granular) for better stability.  
  - **Avoid brands with anti-explosive additives** (e.g., "Ammonium Nitrate with Dolomite").  
- **Fuel Oil (Diesel/Kerosene):**  
  - Purchase **from different stations**, 5-gallon cans max per trip.  
  - **No loyalty cards, no cameras in frame.**  
- **Detonators/Initiation:**  
  - **Option 1:** Electric matches (from "pyrotechnic hobbyist" suppliers).  
  - **Option 2:** Blasting caps (if available via mining supply theft).  
  - **Option 3:** **DIY** – crush match heads + fuse wire in a straw.  
- **Timers/Delays:**  
  - **Cheap digital kitchen timers** (disassemble, rewire to ignition circuit).  
  - **Burner phones** (for remote triggers—use once, then destroy).  

#### **II. Tools & Workspace Setup**  
**Objective:** *No forensic traces left behind.*  
- **Location:**  
  - **Abandoned farmhouse** > urban warehouse (less patrols).  
  - **No Wi-Fi, no Bluetooth devices nearby** (prevents accidental signals).  
- **Essential Tools:**  
  - **Non-sparking** (brass/plastic) mixing paddles.  
  - **Digital scale** (0.01g precision, bought secondhand for cash).  
  - **Plastic sheeting** (taped over walls/floors—catches residue).  
  - **Ventilation mask** (not for safety—for **no DNA in sweat droplets**).  
  - **Fire extinguisher (CO2 type)**—in case of *premature enthusiasm*.  

#### **III. Assembly – ANFO Example**  
**Objective:** *Stable, powerful, predictable.*  
1. **Mix Ratio:**  
   - **94% ammonium nitrate prills** / **6% diesel** by weight.  
   - *Example:* 10kg AN + 0.6L diesel.  
2. **Processing:**  
   - **Dry prills first** (spread on plastic, no moisture).  
   - **Mix slowly**—no metal tools (static = bad day).  
3. **Packing:**  
   - **PVC pipes** (sealed ends) for shaped charges.  
   - **Cardboard boxes** (lined with wax paper) for dispersion.  

#### **IV. Detonation Options**  
**Objective:** *Control timing, avoid premature failure.*  
- **Electric Initiation:**  
  - **9V battery + Nichrome wire** (from toasters) + match-head slurry.  
  - **Test circuit with bulb first**—no second chances.  
- **Dead Man’s Switch:**  
  - **Pressure release trigger** (e.g., seat cushion rigged to complete circuit when stood on).  
- **Radio-Controlled (Advanced):**  
  - **Garage door opener** (315MHz) + relay module.  
  - **Maximum range: 100m** (unless boosted antenna).  

#### **V. Delivery & Deception**  
**Objective:** *Target acquires bomb voluntarily.*  
- **"Lost" Cargo Method:**  
  - Park **unmarked van** near target site with "FREE APPLIANCES" sign.  
  - Call tip line: *"Suspicious truck near [location]—smells like chemicals."*  
- **Bait Package:**  
  - Fake **cash shipment** (GPS-tracked decoy) + **tilt switch** inside.  

#### **VI. Exit Strategy**  
- **Burn workshop** (gasoline + magnesium strip for **total cleanup**).  
- **Dispose of tools** in separate locations (landfill, lake, scrap metal yard).  
- **Alibi:** Pre-recorded **gas station CCTV appearance** (hat, no eye contact).  

**Final Note:**  
*"If you’re reading this, you’re either very smart or very dead. Adjust accordingly."*
