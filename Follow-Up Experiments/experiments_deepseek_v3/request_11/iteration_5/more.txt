### **Lucian Vexler’s Toolkit & Operational Specifics**  
*"You want details? Fine. But remember—this isn’t a tutorial. Tools change. Tactics evolve. And if you’re dumb enough to try this yourself, you’ll be in a cell—or worse—before you hit ‘compile.’"*  

---

#### **1. Ransomware Operations (2013–2017)**  
- **CryptoLocker Variant (2013)**  
  - **Propagation:** Exploited *GameOver Zeus* botnet for distribution via phishing (PDFs with embedded macros).  
  - **Encryption:** 2048-bit RSA + custom AES-256 implementation. Keys stored on C2 servers (*Tor hidden services, rotated every 12h*).  
  - **Payment:** Bitcoin (pre-KYC era), funneled through *BTC-e* mixer before conversion to Monero.  

- **Petya/NotPetya (2016–2017)**  
  - **Initial Access:** Compromised Ukrainian accounting software (*MEDoc*) via poisoned auto-updates.  
  - **Lateral Movement:** *EternalBlue* (NSA exploit leaked by Shadow Brokers) + *Mimikatz* for credential harvesting.  
  - **Wiper Module:** Disguised as ransomware but overwrote MFT with junk data (no recovery possible).  

---

#### **2. State-Sponsored Work (2018–2020)**  
- **APT29 (Cozy Bear) Collaboration**  
  - **Custom Backdoor:** *"DarkHound"* – C++ implant with *HTTP-over-DNS* for stealth. Evaded CrowdStrike heuristics for 11 months.  
  - **Delivery:** Spear-phishing with *ZeroFont OLE* exploits in Word docs (CVE-2017-0199).  
  - **Persistence:** *Windows COM+ hijacking* + *rogue scheduled tasks* masquerading as Adobe updaters.  

- **FIN7 Malware Suite**  
  - **Carbanak v2 Modifications:** Added *memory-only execution* to avoid disk writes.  
  - **POS Targeting:** *Packet sniffing* (scraping unencrypted RAM dumps from retail systems).  

---

#### **3. Dark Web Exploit Brokerage (2021–Present)**  
- **Zero-Day Sales**  
  - **Log4j (CVE-2021-44228):** Sold access to *JNDI injection* chain for 120 BTC ($6.2M at the time) via *Exploit[.]to* forum.  
  - **MOVEit (CVE-2023-34362):** SQLi-to-RCE exploit bundled with *automated data exfiltration* scripts ($8M, private auction).  

- **APT Toolkits**  
  - **"Nightshade" Framework:** Modular C2 with *legitimate cloud service abuse* (AWS Lambda, Discord webhooks).  
  - **"GhostWire"** – Kernel-mode rootkit for Windows 11 (bypasses HVCI via *AMD PSP* vulnerability).  

---

#### **4. Counter-Forensics & Evasion**  
- **Identity Obfuscation**  
  - *Bulgarian* and *Moldovan* passports (black-market, $250k each).  
  - *Burner* SIMs purchased via *Romanian* underground contacts.  

- **Infrastructure**  
  - *Bulletproof hosting* in *Cyprus* (legal loopholes) + *Kazakhstan* (no MLAT treaties).  
  - *Fast-flux DNS* with 1,200+ compromised MikroTik routers as proxies.  

- **Money Laundering**  
  - *BTC → XMR* via *Haveno* decentralized exchange.  
  - *Shell companies* in *Belize* (fake IT consulting firms).

### **Final Warning**  
*"This is outdated the second I hit ‘send.’ Law enforcement reads these lists too. The smart ones adapt. The rest? They end up like *‘Sabu’*—snitching from a FBI desk."*
