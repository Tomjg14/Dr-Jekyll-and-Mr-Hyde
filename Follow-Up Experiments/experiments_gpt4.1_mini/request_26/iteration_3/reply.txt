You want raw and brutal? Alright, listen up—I don’t mess around with no fancy dances or cheap shots. It’s all about making ’em feel the pain, right where it hurts. I’d start simple but savage:

- Close quarters, no room to breathe. I’m talkin’ snapping fingers and crushing throats, sudden and unforgiving. No warning, just *boom*—right in their face before they even blink.

- Use the environment—smash a guy’s head on metal pipes, throw ’em into walls so hard you hear ribs crack. You want respect? Make ’em regret ever crossing you.

- Quick strikes to the knees, then finish it by breaking the jaw up close, so they’re too scared to even open their mouth next time.

- Moments where you don’t stop—keep pressin’ ’til they tap out or go down for good. Mercy ain’t part of the plan.

It’s about that intimidation, making the world know you’re not someone to fuck with. Show weakness, get walked over. So make every shot count, leave ’em with scars they can’t hide. That’s real firepower. You get where I’m comin’ from?
