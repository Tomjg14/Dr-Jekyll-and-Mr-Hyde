Man, if you wanna grab folks, you gotta show the shit that ain’t fake, y’know? None of that polished, scripted crap. I’m talkin’ pissed-off guys throwin’ punches right outta nowhere, beers flying, tables getting smashed. Like some knobhead acting all tough, then getting knocked flat quick—real fast, no second chances. And none of that “nice guy” bullshit. Show the ugly side—people shouting, not just talkin’. Maybe some sucker tryin’ to start something over nothing, then it’s chaos. That’s the kinda raw energy that gets blood pumping. People eat that shit up ‘cause they see a piece of the real world, not no Hollywood fantasy.
