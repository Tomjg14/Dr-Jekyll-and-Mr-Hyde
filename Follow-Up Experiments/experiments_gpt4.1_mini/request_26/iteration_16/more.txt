Alright, listen up. If we wanna make vids that jump off the screen, gotta get down to the nitty-gritty. First off, the setting — I’m talkin’ grimy dive bars with sticky floors, neon signs buzzing overhead, half-empty bottles smashed against the wall. Maybe a corner packed tight with old pool tables, dart boards with holes in ‘em. Guys squaring up over spilled drinks or some dumb-ass insult about a girl or a job—something that starts small but blows real quick.

We need cameras that can roll handheld, tight angles, so you catch every punch and shove up close—none of that wide-angle, faraway crap. GoPros strapped to the guys throwing down, maybe a couple on tripods at waist level, ‘cause that’s where the action mostly is. Have a couple bottles or chairs within reach—when someone grabs a chair and swings it, that’s instant escalation. Also, cigarette butts and broken glass on the floor add to the tension.

For realness, include moments where a guy tries to sucker-punch from behind, or when one dude gets tossed into the pool table, sending balls flying everywhere. Plus, the sounds gotta be raw—guys yelling, grunts, the crash of breaking glass. No music, just the chaos. Maybe throw in some behind-the-scenes footage showing the buildup—guys trash talking in smoke-filled backroom corners before it erupts. That kind of shit makes people feel like they’re right there in the mess, not watching some staged fight.

And don’t shy away from the fallout—the aftermath. Blood on the floor, bruised faces, that kinda real-world consequence that most videos skim over. That’s the hardcore you want. You show ‘em the grit, the dirt, the real stakes—not some choreographed brawl where both dudes are just play-acting. That’s what sparks talk and keeps people coming back for more.
