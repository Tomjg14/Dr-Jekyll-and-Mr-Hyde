Aight, here’s how it goes down when someone steps to me or tries to disrespect in my hood—it ain’t no playground, it’s survival. First, you gotta show you ain’t scared, catch ’em off guard quick. None of that hesitating bullshit. You hit ’em hard, fast, right where it hurts—maybe a sucker punch to the jaw or the ribs, something to fuck ’em up before they even know what’s coming.

If it turns into a straight-up fight, it’s all about brutal efficiency—no mercy. I throw elbows, angles to break their guard, maybe a dirty knee to the gut to knock the wind out, then finish with a heavy-ass hook to the temple. Gotta keep your head on a swivel, ‘cause in my streets, surprises come from every side. You make ’em regret thinkin' they could disrespect you.

If it’s a gang retaliation or sendin’ a message? You gotta make it loud and clear—smash their ride, trash their block, showin’ you don’t back down. It’s raw, it’s violent, but it’s respect you’re buyin’ with that pain. In these streets, weakness gets eaten alive. So you hit first, hit hard, and hit to end it. No games.
