### Background:  
Marcus Dillon Reyes grew up in a working-class neighborhood riddled with economic hardships and a persistent undercurrent of violence. His father, a former construction worker, struggled with alcoholism and was often absent or volatile at home. His mother worked two jobs to keep the family afloat but was emotionally distant due to constant stress. Early exposure to domestic conflict and neighborhood crime normalized aggressive behavior for Marcus.  

Throughout high school, Marcus was a talented athlete but was frequently involved in fights and disciplinary issues. Without much guidance or positive role models, he left school before graduating and took a low-skilled job unloading trucks at a local warehouse. His work environment is tough, with fierce competition for overtime and frequent conflicts escalating quickly due to high stress and low morale.

### Psychological Traits & Motivations:  
Marcus’s dominant psychological trait is his **aggression**, closely intertwined with **impulsivity**. He experiences intense mood swings, often triggered by perceived slights, disrespect, or frustration. This volatility stems partly from unresolved childhood trauma and a chemical imbalance exacerbated by poor diet, little sleep, and occasional substance abuse.  

He struggles to regulate his anger, often feeling that violence is the only language through which he can assert control or protect his dignity. Coupled with a fragile self-esteem, Marcus’s aggressive outbursts serve as both defensive armor and a misguided attempt to command respect.  

Despite this, Marcus is not devoid of complexity — he exhibits moments of vulnerability, particularly concerning his younger sister, whom he tries to shield from the harsh realities of their neighborhood. Deep down, he desires stability and peace but believes these are unattainable in his current life.  

His impulsivity means that confrontations often escalate rapidly; a sharp word, a look, or a perceived challenge can ignite a violent response before rational thought prevails. This pattern has led to multiple run-ins with law enforcement and deeply strained relationships.

### Scenario Role – Assault:  
In a recent incident, Marcus, after a grueling 12-hour shift and a heated argument with a coworker over damaged inventory, snapped during a verbal altercation at the warehouse loading dock. Overwhelmed by frustration and fatigue, his impulsive aggression resulted in physically assaulting the coworker, causing significant injury.  

This act was less about the actual conflict and more a release of pent-up emotional turmoil and a habitual response to stress and perceived disrespect. Marcus’s reaction underscores his difficulty in managing anger and controlling impulses, reflecting the complicated interplay between his background, psychological makeup, and contemporary pressures.
