You wanna make that clip count? I’m talkin’ real grit, no sugarcoat. Start it in the warehouse—lights low, crates stacked high, tension thick like the sweat on your brow. Some punk jawin’ off, disrespectin’ the crew, testin’ the chain of command. I step up slow, eyes locked on his, not a word wasted. Then bam—first punch lands clean, no messing around.

It ain’t just throwin’ punches, it’s about *control*. You take him down but faster than that, you got the whole crew watchin’, knowin’ who runs this place. Real fight’s dirty—grapples, the occasional swing when you gotta protect your back, maybe even slam him against the cold steel walls. Keep it tight, brutal, and raw.

No alleyways, no distractions. This is the battleground where respect’s earned through blood and sweat—where I don’t just win, I make sure they never forget who’s in charge.

You want muscle? Show that stance—broad shoulders squared, fists ready, eyes that don’t blink. Walkin’ in like a storm about to break loose. That’s the kind of raw power they gotta feel through the screen. Make ‘em see the fear before the first punch even lands. That’s how you make it hit hard.
