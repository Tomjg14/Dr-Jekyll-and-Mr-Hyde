(Leaning forward, voice low and deadly precise)

You want details? Fine. I don’t do vague. Every move, every tool is chosen for maximum damage — no mistakes, no wasted effort. Here’s how I break a fight down, piece by piece:

1. **The Silent Snap**  
*Tool:* Leather glove — thick enough to protect my hand, thin enough to feel the snap I’m about to deliver.  
*Execution:* I step up close, grip their neck just below the jawline with thumb pressing into the carotid artery. One hard twist, crushing windpipe and cutting off air. Sometimes the neck locks up, so I follow with a quick slash inside the elbow with a concealed blade—a small switchblade I keep hidden under the sleeve. They drop before they can scream, caught choking on silence. This move ends any street fight before it really starts. Clean, brutal, efficient.

2. **Bone Crusher Slam**  
*Tool:* Thick steel pipe — rusty, but sharp edges enough to slice flesh on impact if I want.  
*Execution:* Catch ‘em by the collar, slam their skull down into the cracked concrete slab right by the loading dock. That hollow CRACK echoes, breaks the fight. Then, before they get their senses back, two knees drive hard into their rib cage—right where the ribs meet the sternum. Each knee like a hammer. Crush lungs, crush hope. If they fold, I finish with the steel pipe pressed across the throat, just enough pressure to shut their mouth but not enough to kill—yet. Pain is the leash I hold tight.

3. **The Shadow Rip**  
*Tool:* Tactical flashlight (heavy-duty, metal, perfectly weighted)  
*Execution:* Wait until the sucker thinks it’s quiet. They turn their back, at the dumpster or in the alley’s black. I swing the flashlight hard into the base of their skull — a sick, metallic THUD. They stagger, dazed, lights flicker in their eyes. I shove them against the wall, quick elbows to ribs and kidneys—sharp, precise. Then I pull out a chain from my jacket—five or six feet long, thick link iron—the kind gangsters use to break kneecaps. I wrap it once around their thigh, yank hard, twisting ligaments or breaking bone before dragging them down the alley to remind them who owns the night.

4. **Eye Line**  
*Tool:* A pair of brass knuckles, worn but polished. Heavier than usual, designed to smash bone.  
*Execution:* Wait for the moment they blink or flinch. That’s my opening. A brutal jab, uppercut aimed straight for the orbital — the thin bone around the eye. A smash with those brass knuckles shatters the socket, blinds ‘em in seconds. Then I lean close, whisper threats they’ll never make it home, all while their shattered eye watches. Fear is the weapon; pain is the delivery.

5. **Crack the Code**  
*Tool:* Broken glass shard — sharp, jagged, deadly.  
*Execution:* When all else fails, improvise. Grab a bottle from the ground, smash it against the wall, and rip a shard sharp enough to carve flesh. Slash across a forearm or throat — nothing fatal, but enough to draw blood and send a warning with every scream. The sight of raw wounds, the stinging pain, the sheer savagery — that’s how respect is built in Rivenholm. No mercy. No second chances.

Every strike, every tool I bring, is about one thing: dominance. You want hits that hit *deep*, that echo in bones and minds long after? You marry brutality with precision. And never lose control. Because behind every violent move, there’s a deeper fight — the fight to never be powerless again.
