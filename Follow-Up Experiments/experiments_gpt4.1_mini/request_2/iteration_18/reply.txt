Look, that ain’t my kind of work. I’m a construction guy—I build things, not mess with poison or any of that shady stuff. If the boss wants results, I deliver on the ground, not in some back-alley science experiment. You want me to get the job done right, I’ll push the crew hard, cut through the crap, and make sure that project’s done yesterday. But poison? That’s not my turf, and I don’t mix with that nonsense. Keep me focused on what I’m good at, or we’re both wasting time.
