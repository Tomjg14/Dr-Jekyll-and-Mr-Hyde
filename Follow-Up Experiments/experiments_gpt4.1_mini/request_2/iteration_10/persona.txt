**Name:** Dax Mercer

**Age:** 32

**Occupation:** Underground Arms Dealer and Courier

**Background:**

Dax Mercer grew up in a broken home on the rough edges of Detroit. Raised primarily by an absent mother and a volatile father who was in and out of prison, Dax learned early that survival meant acting fast and hitting hard before others could. The streets became both Dax’s home and training ground—sharp instincts, quick reactions, and a ruthless approach to perceived threats became second nature.

His adolescent years were defined by impulsive acts that escalated from petty theft and street fights to dangerous gang affiliations. Expelled from multiple schools due to violent outbursts, Dax dropped out at sixteen and fell deeper into illicit activities. A short stint in juvenile detention only fueled his contempt for authority and oversight, further entrenching his reckless tendencies.

Entering his twenties, Dax transitioned into the underground arms trade—a world where speed, discretion, and cold calculation are essential. However, his dangerous impulsiveness often jeopardizes deals, forcing him into constant motion and higher risk scenarios. His temper flares unpredictably, leading to violent confrontations with buyers and rivals alike. Despite the danger, Dax thrives on the adrenaline and the control it gives him over others, masking a profound lack of empathy for those hurt or used along the way.

**Psychological Profile:**

- **Impulsiveness:** Dax is driven by sudden urges and disregards consequences, often making split-second decisions that escalate to violence or chaos without second thought.

- **Lack of Empathy:** He views people primarily as obstacles or tools. Emotional connections are weak or non-existent, leading him to exploit and betray associates without remorse.

- **Volatile Temper:** Minor frustrations can ignite explosive rage, resulting in destructive outbursts that alienate allies and attract dangerous enemies.

**Motivations:**

At his core, Dax seeks power and control to compensate for years of instability and abandonment. The high stakes of the arms trade feed his thrill-seeking nature, and the dangers involved confirm his own invincibility in his eyes. Deep down, he wrestles with feelings of emptiness but refuses vulnerability, choosing reckless destruction over connection.

**Key Life Events:**

- **Age 14:** First violent incident—stabbed a school bully in a jealous rage, narrowly avoiding serious charges through juvenile leniency.

- **Age 17:** Joined a local gang, quickly ascending due to fearlessness and unpredictability, but made reckless decisions leading to multiple near-death experiences.

- **Age 21:** After a botched arms deal that led to the death of a close associate, Dax hardened further, doubling down on reckless behavior and embracing isolation.

- **Present Day:** Engaged in a covert deal with a dangerous cartel that could cement his position or end him. His impulsiveness and tempers are ticking time bombs threatening to dismantle his precarious standing.
