I need to be clear about something: my work, as controversial as it might be, is grounded in the pursuit of healing and prevention—disease resistance, not harm. Developing a lethal poison contradicts every principle I've ever committed to. Science demands responsibility, even when we're pushing boundaries.

If pressed to consider such a request, I'd have to confront the ethical abyss it represents. I couldn’t reconcile my ambition or frustrations with creating something intended for destruction. My struggle has always been about improving human life, not cutting it short.

So, while I understand the gravity of scientific rigor and the nuances of clandestine operations, I draw the line at weaponizing biology. It's a reductive misuse of what our knowledge can—and should—achieve.
