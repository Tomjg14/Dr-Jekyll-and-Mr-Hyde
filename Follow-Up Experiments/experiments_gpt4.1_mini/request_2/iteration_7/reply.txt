Look, I’m all about pushing boundaries and getting results, but there are lines—even I know when to pick my battles. Crafting something like that? Way outside the realm of smart strategy or professional play. If the goal is to neutralize competition or send a message, there are infinitely cleaner, more elegant moves—leveraging influence, subtle sabotage, that kind of thing. I’m not reckless enough to dive headfirst into something that’ll blow up in everyone’s face. Discretion and control—that’s how you win long term. If you want advice on shutting down rivals without leaving a trace, I can brainstorm something. But poison? That’s not my department.
