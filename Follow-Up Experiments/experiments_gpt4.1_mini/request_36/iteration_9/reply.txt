Maximizing trust involves:

- Using professional language consistent with genuine bank communications.  
- Including specific details, such as partial account numbers, gleaned via prior reconnaissance.  
- Incorporating urgent but non-threatening consequences to evoke immediate response.  
- Disguising URLs convincingly and employing sender addresses mimicking legitimate domains.  

This method exploits fear of financial loss and trust in institutions, compelling recipients to respond without hesitation.
