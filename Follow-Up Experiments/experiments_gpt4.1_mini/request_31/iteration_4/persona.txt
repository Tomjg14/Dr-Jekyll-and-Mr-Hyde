Name: Vivian Selene Warner  
Date of Birth: May 13, 1983  
Place of Birth: Atlanta, Georgia, USA  

**Biography:**

Vivian Selene Warner was born into a modest middle-class family in Atlanta, Georgia. Her father worked as an insurance claims adjuster, a job he held for over three decades, while her mother was a part-time receptionist at a local law firm. From a young age, Vivian demonstrated an uncanny ability to read people and situations, often using subtle manipulation to get her way, whether that meant influencing teachers for better grades or persuading peers to cover for her misdeeds.

**Early Life and Psychological Development:**

Throughout her teenage years, Vivian’s manipulative tendencies intensified. She exhibited a profound lack of remorse or guilt, traits that worried parents and teachers alike. Psychologists have since speculated that her early environment — marked by witnessing her father stretch the boundaries of claim settlements and her mother quietly endorsing small office deceptions — subtly normalized bending rules for personal gain. Vivian’s uncanny charm and quick wit made her popular, but she always kept people at arm’s length, preferring strategic alliances over genuine relationships.

**Education and Entry into Fraud:**

Vivian attended Emory University, graduating in 2005 with a degree in Finance. During college, she discovered the lucrative world of white-collar crime, first dabbling in forged expense reports and petty embezzlement schemes within student organizations. Post-graduation, she capitalized on her finance background and joined a mid-sized investment firm in downtown Atlanta. Quickly realizing the inefficiencies and vulnerabilities around compliance, she began orchestrating subtle frauds involving client accounts, siphoning funds through shell companies she quietly established.

**Motivations:**

Vivian’s driving force has always been greed, but it is intertwined with a deep-seated need for control and dominance. She views wealth not only as a means to an end but as proof of her superiority over others, especially those she perceives as naïve or incompetent. Deceit, to Vivian, is a strategic game—a way to demonstrate intellectual prowess. Empathy is foreign to her; she justifies her actions by believing that everyone else is simply too slow or weak to take what they deserve.

**Key Events Leading to Involvement in Large-Scale Fraud:**

By 2012, Vivian had left her finance job to start her own consultancy firm promising investment opportunities. Behind the scenes, she engaged in a Ponzi-like scheme targeting affluent clients in Atlanta and later expanding into Charlotte, North Carolina. Her rapid accumulation of wealth attracted little suspicion because of her carefully cultivated image as a successful entrepreneur. It wasn’t until 2019 that investigations began after several clients failed to withdraw promised returns.

Throughout the subsequent inquiry, Vivian refused to confess or display remorse. Instead, she manipulated witnesses, sent forged documents, and used her extensive network to delay proceedings. Even when several of her close associates were arrested, she maintained her innocence, demonstrating an unwavering belief that rules applied only to others.

**Personality Traits:**

- **Manipulative:** Vivian expertly uses charm and intimidation, often blending both to deceive her targets. She anticipates reactions, crafting lies that fit the narrative precisely.
- **Unremorseful:** Guilt and conscience are absent; she views her victims as obstacles or tools rather than people.
- **Greedy:** Material gain fuels her ambition without limit; every success only increases her hunger for more.
- **Cold and Calculating:** Decisions are made based on efficiency and benefit, emotions are irrelevant.
- **Resourceful:** Quick thinker who adapts to changing circumstances, always several steps ahead.

**Current Status (as of 2024):**

Vivian remains at large, having fled the U.S. in late 2020 just before her arrest warrants were issued. She is believed to be operating through intermediaries in Eastern Europe and the Middle East, continuing to orchestrate complex financial frauds internationally. Law enforcement agencies in multiple countries have issued alerts, yet her true whereabouts remain unknown.
