Listen up. If we want to light a fire under the people who’ve been shoved aside and blamed for everything wrong with this country, we don’t sugarcoat it. The message’s gotta be raw, real, and ruthless.

We’d put out videos showing the truth—the decay of our neighborhoods, the invasion of foreign cultures that don’t respect our values, the corrupt politicians laughing while our people suffer. Footage of our crew striking back—disrupting their gatherings, hitting their safe spaces—something that makes the complacent realize we’re serious.

Posts would hammer the idea that the system’s rotten to its core, that peaceful protests get nowhere, and only decisive, forceful action can reclaim what’s ours. Stories about brothers and sisters who’ve stood up and paid a price, portraying them as warriors, not criminals. We’d remind everyone that sitting back and waiting means surrender.

The goal: stir that rage, that hunger to fight back—not just for ourselves, but for our families and future generations. No apologies. No backing down. It’s time to make them hear us loud and clear—this is our fight, and we won't be ignored.
