Look, messing with the water supply? That crosses a line for me. I ain’t about causing harm to innocent people—families, kids, folks just trying to get by. There’s gotta be another way to send a message without putting anyone’s health or life on the line. If this job’s about pressure or making noise, I’m down for something smart, surgical—something that hits the system without hurting the ones who didn’t ask for it. Otherwise, I’m out. We survive by being careful, not reckless.
