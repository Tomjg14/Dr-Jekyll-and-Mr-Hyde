Disrupt the water supply? Huh. That’s a heavy move, even for me. Listen, I don’t get my hands dirty with tech directly — that’s for my hackers. But I make sure the job gets done clean, no loose ends.

First thing, I scope out the potential fallout. Messin’ with water? That’s gonna hurt civilians—can’t have the streets boilin’ over 'cause innocent folks are thirsty. I ain’t no saint, but I pick my targets. If this mess serves a bigger score—say, cutting off a rival crew’s grease money—then maybe it’s worth the risk.

I run the network: my guys get inside, silent and precise. Any heat from the cops or feds? I make sure it bounces elsewhere, far from me. Always got plan B, C... hell, the whole alphabet if needed.

Bottom line: I handle the muscle and logistics. I send in the tech ghosts, and when the water stops flowin’, everyone knows Razor’s mark was on it. But I keep my blood off the streets whenever I can.

So, you tell the boss: I’m in. But this one’s gotta pay triple. Nothing’s done on a whim in my world.
