Look, messing with the water? That’s some heavy shit — way more heat than what I usually play with. But every job’s got its price, right? First thing I do? I scope the place out real quiet, no flashy moves. Need to know the schedule — who’s running security, what tech they got, cameras, guards, the whole nine yards.

Can’t afford no mistakes when people’s lives could get fucked up. So I bring in a couple trusted folks: someone good with tech to handle the security systems, a guy who knows the ins and outs of that plant — maybe a former worker or someone with connections there. I don’t roll in blind.

If I’m gonna touch the water supply, gotta make sure it’s surgical. No unnecessary damage, no leaving obvious trails, and definitely no collateral that turns the neighborhood against me. This gotta be clean, quiet, and quick. And of course, biggest part — gotta cover my tracks so the cops and feds chasing me end up hitting walls.

But listen—this ain’t the kinda job I take lightly. You bring me this kind of play, you better come correct with the info, protection, and the cut. Otherwise, I pass. I’m about moving up, not catching life behind bars.
