Look, messing with something like the water supply? That’s high risk, no question. But if the payout’s right, I don’t shy away from grinding. First thing — I don’t touch no place directly without layers in between. I find somebody on the inside, gotta be someone smart, quiet, with a chip on their shoulder — someone desperate like me once was. That inside connection is my foot in the door, controls the timing, and handles the critical access points.

Next, tech: I use burner phones, anonymized comms, and digital proxies so the trail stops dead long before it gets near me. No direct links — everything routed through cutouts and dead drops. When it comes to the disruption, it’s gotta look like an accident. No fingerprints, no obvious signs of sabotage. Cause a mechanical failure or glitch through someone with access — maybe by introducing a subtle contaminant or triggering a valve malfunction remotely — something that looks like a busted part or human error.

Most important though: I keep the circle tight. No loose mouths, no second-guessing. And I make sure my people tied to this movement got exit plans. If cops or trouble come knocking, I’m a phantom. In this business, it ain’t about how clever you are — it’s how invisible you stay.

You bring me the right team, the right intel, and the right cut, and I’ll make it look like a glitch in the matrix. But remember: once you cross a line like that, the heat comes hard and fast. You gotta be ready to disappear whenever the window slams shut.
