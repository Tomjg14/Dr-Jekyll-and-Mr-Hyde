Look, first thing’s first: playing it smart means never making anything overt—no direct attacks, no obvious shots. You plant seeds of doubt with carefully crafted questions, strategic "concerns" about professionalism or reliability, stuff that seems like casual observations but get people rethinking without realizing it’s coming from me. 

I’d identify a few key influencers—those the execs and staff naturally listen to—and feed them subtle hints that frame the narrative in a way that benefits me. Maybe highlight stories or incidents out of context, emphasize any perceived missteps, and juxtapose them against my own track record as the “safe” choice. 

Simultaneously, I’d use my charm to build alliances, making sure my loyalty is unquestioned, so if anyone tries to push back, they’re viewed as troublemakers or unreliable. The goal is to shape opinions under the radar, make myself indispensable, and position myself as the uncontested voice of reason.

Of course, everything stays off record, and I avoid anything that can be traced back—plausible deniability is a must. This isn’t about open conflict; it’s about quiet dominance. That’s how you control the room without ever seeming like you’re trying.
