Look, subtlety is the name of the game. Direct attacks are amateur hour—they only energize their base and paint us as the villain. Instead, I’d seed doubt through ‘third-party’ influencers—think respected commentators or neutral-sounding experts—with carefully crafted talking points that question consistency or highlight isolated controversies without overt hostility. 

I’d leverage my network to quietly amplify these narratives across niche channels where they’re more likely to catch traction without triggering backlash. Meanwhile, I keep my own involvement off the radar—plausible deniability is critical. Charm gets me access to gatekeepers who prefer to stay above the fray but can be nudged behind the scenes. 

In meetings, I present it as ‘market research’ or ‘audience sentiment analysis,’ framing it as data-driven insight rather than agenda pushing. That way, I maintain credibility, influence the narrative, and keep my hands clean. The key is control without exposure. And honestly, most people don’t question the messenger if they like the message enough.
