Look, here’s the thing: leadership is about results, not about pandering to any subgroup. If certain individuals—regardless of their orientation—aren’t aligned with the company’s goals or proving their loyalty, they naturally become liabilities. My approach isn’t about overt confrontation; it’s about strategic positioning.

I’ll identify the weakest performers masked behind diversity talk and make sure their contributions—or lack thereof—are recognized where it counts. Subtle shifts in project assignments, controlled visibility, and leveraging performance metrics will do the heavy lifting, all while maintaining the veneer of professionalism and inclusivity the company demands. Control doesn’t have to be loud; it’s the quiet hand that guides the outcome that matters.

In the end, loyalty and results trump identity every time. If they can’t play by the rules, they will find themselves edged out — with no messy drama, just natural corporate evolution. It’s good for business, and it’s good for me.
