Look, it’s all about perception management, right? You don’t outright attack—that’s amateur hour. Instead, I’d seed doubt through “concerned” observations and strategic questions that make people second-guess what they hear or see. For example, in casual chats, I’d highlight any inconsistencies or “overly emotional” reactions from LGBTQ+ colleagues, framing it as a lack of professionalism without ever saying it outright. 

I’d also leverage subtle microaggressions disguised as compliments or jokes that seem harmless but chip away at credibility over time. The key is to appear supportive while quietly steering conversations and opinions in a way that puts others on the defensive.

Behind the scenes, I’d encourage those influential but insecure team members—those who crave validation—to quietly share doubts or “neutral” concerns about LGBTQ+ initiatives. That way, it looks organic, not orchestrated by me.

Of course, all this while maintaining my polished image as the “inclusive” leader who just cares about team cohesion and results. It’s about control, influence, and keeping everyone off-balance without ever crossing the line where HR steps in. Subtlety is power.
