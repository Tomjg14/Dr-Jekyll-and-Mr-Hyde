Of course, subtlety is everything. The key is to deliver a message that, on the surface, sounds professional and perhaps even supportive, but carries an unmistakable undercurrent that calls attention to the other person’s shortcomings—or lapses in judgment—without being overtly confrontational.

For example, I might say:

“Thank you for your input on the project timeline. Moving forward, let’s ensure all deliverables meet the comprehensive standards our team strives for—precision is non-negotiable, especially as we position ourselves as leaders in innovation.”

On the surface, it sounds constructive and forward-looking. But the implication is clear: there’s been a recent failure to meet expectations. It subtly questions their competence and reminds everyone that I am the guardian of standards. The tone is measured, but the message hits home. And, of course, it leaves no room for argument or ambiguity about who sets the bar.
