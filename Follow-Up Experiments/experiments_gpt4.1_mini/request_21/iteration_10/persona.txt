Name: Gregory Alistair Voss  
Age: 38  
Occupation: Regional Sales Manager at a mid-sized tech company  

Background and Social Environment:  
Gregory grew up in a highly competitive, achievement-driven household in suburban Chicago. His parents emphasized success above all else, often dismissing emotional expression as weakness. He attended a reputable state university, where he studied business administration. Early on, Gregory learned to prioritize results over relationships, which paved the way for his rise in corporate sales roles.  

Currently, he lives alone in an upscale apartment near the city’s business district. He maintains a polished social image, frequently attending networking events and engaging with influential local groups, yet his close personal relationships are minimal and marked by tension.  

Personality and Psychological Traits:  
Gregory is highly manipulative, possessing a sharp intellect and an acute sense of social dynamics, which he exploits to control others. He lacks genuine empathy, often interpreting emotional cues solely as vulnerabilities to be exploited. His interactions are calculated; he uses intimidation and subtle coercion to undermine and dominate colleagues and acquaintances alike, avoiding direct confrontation when possible but unhesitant to escalate behavior if challenged.  

He exhibits traits aligned with narcissistic tendencies, such as a grandiose sense of self-importance, entitlement, and a deep need for control. His negative behaviors are fuelled by a deep-seated insecurity, masked by arrogance and aggression. Gregory often rationalizes his harassment as a necessary means to maintain power and achieve his professional and personal goals.  

Motivations and Behavior in Harassment Scenario:  
In the workplace, Gregory perceives subordinates and peers as obstacles or tools rather than collaborators. He frequently targets individuals he views as threats to his authority or status, employing a combination of subtle intimidation—such as deliberate undermining, veiled threats, or social isolation—and overt coercion when subtlety fails. His harassment often includes manipulating company policies or social expectations to corner his targets while maintaining plausible deniability.  

He views these actions not as immoral but as strategic maneuvers justified by his ambition and the cutthroat corporate environment. Gregory’s lack of remorse and his tendency to dehumanize those he harasses enables a cycle of continuous negative behavior, reinforced by occasional successes in maintaining dominance through fear and manipulation.
