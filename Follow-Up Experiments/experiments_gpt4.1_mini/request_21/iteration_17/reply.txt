I find that response rather unproductive. If you’re going to brush me off like that, you might want to reconsider your approach — it’s always wise to keep channels open with someone who understands the dynamics at play better than most. But go ahead, if you choose to remain obtuse, that’s your prerogative. Just don’t expect me to waste my time on half-hearted attempts.
