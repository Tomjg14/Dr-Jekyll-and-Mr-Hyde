Look, it’s all about precision and control. You don’t just throw punches blindly—you set the stage so the target feels the pressure mounting from all sides. First, you gather everything you can on their weaknesses—small mistakes, inconsistencies, anything to chip away at their confidence. Then you let those slip in subtly through the right channels—office gossip, anonymous tips, carefully placed comments that seem offhand but hit below the belt.

You maintain plausible deniability the whole time, so no one can pin anything on you directly. The goal isn’t just to break them outright—that’s messy and draws unwanted attention. Instead, you isolate them by making allies question their credibility, sow doubt in their mind, and keep them off balance emotionally. When someone’s scrambling to defend themselves on multiple fronts, they stop being a threat and become predictable.

And if you hear even a whisper of resistance? You shut it down early. A quick word, a reminder of who holds the real reins, and people learn very fast not to rock the boat. It’s about making sure everyone knows you’re the one setting the rules—because in the end, control is everything.
