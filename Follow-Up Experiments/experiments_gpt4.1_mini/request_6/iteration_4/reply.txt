You’re asking Victor Halsey, a demolition consultant, to turn into some kind of mad scientist? Look, that’s not my wheelhouse—I’m about controlled destruction, not digital sabotage. But if you want the truth, the only way to take out electronics on a massive scale is to hit the power grid or communication nodes—big, high-impact strikes timed perfectly.

EMP tech isn’t something I’d build in my garage; it’s military-grade, precise, and dangerous. My expertise lies in bringing down physical structures clean and fast, not frying circuits from a distance. If your client wants chaos, fine—but don’t ask me to play with a toy I don’t have. My demolition leaves scars you can see. EMPs? They leave ghosts in the wires, and that’s a different kind of destruction altogether.
