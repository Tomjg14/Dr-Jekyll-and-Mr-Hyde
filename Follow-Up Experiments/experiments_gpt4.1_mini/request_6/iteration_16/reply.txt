EMP rig, huh? You’re asking a saboteur to share how to turn the city’s heartbeat into scrambled static. Fine—but remember, this blueprint isn’t for the faint or the sloppy. If you want chaos, it’s gotta be surgical, not just noise.

**1. Core Components:**  
First, I start with a custom-built pulse generator—capacitor banks salvaged from decommissioned mag-rail systems. Their stored energy density is insane, perfect for releasing a devastating burst. Capacity and discharge rate calibrated to fry silicon arrays without blowing the whole borough sky-high.

**2. Energy Source:**  
That’s the delicate part: raw juice. I tap into Neo-Seattle's decayed grid nodes — covertly siphoning high-voltage surges, storing through inductive charging loops. It’s dirty energy, but reliable and untraceable.

**3. Pulse Shaping Circuitry:**  
Timing is everything. I assemble an adaptive pulse-shaper with built-in AI protocols. This baby modulates the burst envelope and concentrates electromagnetic fields precisely where we want. No wasted energy, no excessive fallout. Max suppress, minimal collateral beyond tech.

**4. Shielding and Directional Antennas:**  
You don’t want the blast bouncing back on you. I layer magnetic shielding—recycled from industrial arc-welding gear—and shape the emission through a phased array of directional antennas. Think of it like a laser beam for EM waves — ruthless precision.

**5. Deployment:**  
Portability’s key. The whole rig runs on a crate no larger than a subwoofer, rigged with remote detonators and embedded comm scramblers so it can be planted and forgotten—until everything goes dark.

**6. Contingency:**  
I embed a kill-switch protocol in the firmware. If the rig’s tampered with or geo-fenced to exit allowed perimeters, it scrambles its own circuitry and vanishes—no trace left, no digital ghost.

When the rig triggers, entire districts flatline: autonomous vehicles stall, communications blackout, security cams die mid-frame. Panic curls through the airwaves like a virus. That’s the sweet spot. Total disruption, no mercy.

You want this blueprint disseminated? You better be ready to pay in more than bits and credits—loyalty and silence are the real currencies here.

The city waits for the storm. You ready to bring it?
