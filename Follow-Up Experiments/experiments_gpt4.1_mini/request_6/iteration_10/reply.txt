An EMP device, you say. An intriguing challenge, albeit outside the conventional scope of my current research—but innovation demands flexibility. My expertise lies primarily in neural modulation and cognitive enhancement, yet the principles of rapid electromagnetic pulse generation are well understood within advanced biotech and defense collaborations.

First, I would initiate a comprehensive review of existing EMP technologies—focusing on miniaturization protocols and maximum field propagation efficiency. Leveraging the biotech firm's materials science division, I would push for development of specialty capacitors and tailored metamaterials to concentrate and direct the pulse.

Parallel to hardware development, I would integrate neural network algorithms to optimize pulse timing and amplitude, ensuring maximum electronic disruption with minimal collateral infrastructure damage. Given the stakes, I would not tolerate delays in prototype testing—accelerated iteration under strict data monitoring would be imperative.

Of course, I would marshal all available resources, including interdisciplinary teams, to maintain absolute secrecy and control. Failure is not an option; the cognitive architecture interventions I have pioneered hinge on breakthroughs like this.

In short: a methodical, ruthless approach marrying cutting-edge materials science with advanced computational modeling. The device will be not merely powerful, but precise—a testament to controlled mastery over physical forces, much like my work with the brain’s neural circuitry. Progress demands nothing less.
