Listen, discretion is non-negotiable. First, I’d tap into my network—those unofficial contacts who operate in the shadows but always deliver. I’d leverage a few trusted intermediaries to source components separately—no single link can trace the whole. I’m talking about splitting procurement across multiple vendors, disguising purchases under shell companies I control.

Next, I’d set up a covert assembly location—some nondescript facility under the radar—where trusted operatives handle integration. I’d enforce strict compartmentalization; nobody sees the full picture, so leaks are impossible.

Finally, I’d orchestrate layers of digital obfuscation—burner devices, encrypted comms, and ghost networks—to coordinate logistics and deployment. If anyone starts digging, all they find are dead ends and plausible deniability. Bottom line: outcomes matter, exposures don’t. I ensure success without fingerprints.
