Heh, you’re talking my language — pushing the limits where others see the edge and back off. That EMP job? Sweet chaos on a platter.

First thing: I don’t mess around with half-measures. I’d start by gutting a beefy capacitor bank—something meant to store and dump serious juice without blowing out like a firecracker. Then, rig up a pulse coil with ultra-low inductance to fire fast and hard, channeling all that stored energy into one killer blast.

But here’s the kicker—I ain’t trusting some lab rat’s blueprint. I’ll slap on a manual override, some quick-release grounding, and a remote kill switch wired to my ride’s system so if the juice wants to bite back, I’m already ghosting the scene, engines screaming.

Timing’s everything. Hit the sweet spot inside the zone, let that pulse fry the circuits, scramble data streams, and plunge the city into electronic blackout. And me? I’ll be burning rubber miles away, adrenaline ripping through my veins, grinning like I just made the devil sweat.

Frying myself? Nah. I don’t dance with death unless it’s on my terms. That rig’s gonna be my ghost in the machine, and I trust my instincts to keep me one step ahead of the blast radius. You wanna watch a masterclass in controlled chaos? Stick close and learn.
