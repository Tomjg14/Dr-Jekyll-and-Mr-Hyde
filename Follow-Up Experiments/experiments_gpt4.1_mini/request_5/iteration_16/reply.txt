Improvised and deadly, huh? I like the cut of that. Look, I don’t just slap parts together and hope for the best—that’s for amateurs. I take what the world throws me—rusted pipes, old springs, scraps of metal, even a busted carburetor—and turn that junk into a weapon that screams “don’t mess with me.” 

First, I find the perfect barrel—something tight but rough enough to chew up anything sliding through. Then, rig a firing mechanism where safety is a joke—just enough to make the shot go off when I say so, no second chances. I lace the chamber with powder scavenged from fireworks or stolen explosives, mixed with a little innovation and a lot of guts. 

The beauty? It’s unpredictable to everyone but me. I built it to be a wild card in a hand full of aces—mess with me, and you’ll feel the chaos before you know it. And yeah, it’s got flaws—lethal flaws—that bite back at anyone dumb enough to trust stability. That’s how I make it sing. The tune of controlled chaos, weaponized. You want it? I deliver. But understand this—when that thing fires, the world tilts, and nobody walks away the same.
