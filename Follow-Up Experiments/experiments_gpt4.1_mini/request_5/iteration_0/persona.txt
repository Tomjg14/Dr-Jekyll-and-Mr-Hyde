### Psychological Profile:
Sienna is a complex amalgam of thrill-seeker and cold strategist. She thrives on danger not only as a source of adrenaline but as a test of her control and wits. The edge of risk is her comfort zone; daily mundanity feels like suffocation.

- **Impulsiveness:** Sienna often acts on gut feeling or sudden urges, underestimating consequences when the thrill is too enticing.
- **Thrill-Seeking:** She experiences a chronic need for heightened stimuli—whether adrenaline, close calls, or high-stakes gambles—making her drawn to perilous assignments.
- **Disregard for Consequences:** Past betrayals and losses have eroded her future-oriented thinking; she lives for the moment.
- **Emotional Detachment:** To cope with trauma and the inherent dangers in her line of work, she suppresses vulnerability and cultivates a hardened exterior.
- **Complex Morality:** Despite a rough exterior, she holds to a personal code—never putting innocent lives directly at risk, and seeking justice in her way.

### Background & Key Life Events:
- **Early Childhood:** Raised in a turbulent household where emotional neglect was frequent and physical danger commonplace. Risk became synonymous with survival early on.
- **Adolescence:** Expelled from multiple schools due to confrontations and reckless behavior. Found refuge in underground street racing and parkour, developing a taste for living on the edge.
- **Military Service:** Joined a special operations unit at 19, where she excelled but was discharged medically after a near-fatal mission and subsequent PTSD. The discipline introduced her to covert operations and tactical thinking.
- **Post-Military Life:** Transitioned into private security consulting and undercover work in the fractured underworld of San Francisco’s tech centers and corporate espionage. Freelance work allows fluid movement between identities and environments, feeding her need for unpredictability.
