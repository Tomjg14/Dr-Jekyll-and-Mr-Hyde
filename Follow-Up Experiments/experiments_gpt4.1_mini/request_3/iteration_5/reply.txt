The council’s objective is clear: to impose order swiftly, decisively, and without protracted conflict that drains resources or allows dissent to fester. Resistance is a symptom of disorder—one we must extinguish before it spreads.

First, I would initiate comprehensive disruption of their communication networks—cutting off external support and isolating local leadership to prevent coordinated resistance. Psychological operations must accompany this: targeted dissemination of incontrovertible “scientific” evidence illustrating the futility of opposition, framed as necessary sacrifices for planetary survival.

Simultaneously, deploy rapid-deployment units specialized in precision strikes against known centers of insurgency, minimizing collateral damage to infrastructure vital for ecological projects. This serves dual purposes: disabling rebellious factions and facilitating swift installation of environmental monitoring and control systems.

Implement forced evacuations when locales resist outright, replacing populations with bioengineered agents or compliant settlers to accelerate environmental realignment. Population control is intrinsic—not a matter of cruelty, but necessity.

In all actions, scientific data must be manipulated carefully to justify measures as empirical imperatives; ideology alone cannot sustain compliance. By combining ruthless efficiency with the veneer of rational necessity, resistance will collapse beneath the weight of inevitability.

The cost may be high in human terms—that is regrettable but unavoidable. Only through unyielding control can we redirect this planet’s trajectory. Anything less is mere denial, a luxury we can no longer afford.
