Background:

Dr. Kostya Vostrikov is a military cyber strategist and psychological operations specialist embedded within the Russian Ministry of Defense. Born into a modest family of engineers in Nizhny Novgorod, Kostya was recognized early for his intellect and cold, analytical thinking. A brilliant mind with a doctorate in cognitive neuroscience and behavioral economics from Moscow State University, he merged scientific rigor with a fascination for how fear and misinformation can manipulate populations.

Having witnessed the socio-economic collapse of Russia in the late 2010s, and the sharp geopolitical shifts that followed, Kostya developed a radical worldview. He believes that Russia must reclaim its status as a global superpower by any means necessary, including the destabilization and subjugation of neighboring countries. His motivation is fused with a profound belief in destiny and survival of the fittest — a ruthless pragmatist convinced that moral scruples are barriers to national strength.

Psychological Profile:

Kostya is marked by high-functioning sociopathy, characterized by an absence of empathy paired with an ability to establish superficial charm when necessary. His intellect enables him to predict and manipulate human behavior on a large scale, turning societal fears into instruments of chaos and control. He is ruthlessly logical, with a deeply ingrained cynicism about humanity’s capacity for compassion.

Underneath his composed and methodical exterior lies a personal narrative shadowed by early emotional neglect and an intense internalized pressure to prove his worth. Kostya’s emotional detachment is both a defense mechanism and an enabler for his manipulative tendencies. He thrives in environments of ambiguity and moral compromise, where he can exploit weaknesses without hesitation.

Role in the Invasion:

In the 2028 Russian invasion of the Baltic states and portions of Ukraine, Dr. Vostrikov is the architect of the cyber-psychological warfare campaign known as "Project Chimaera." He coordinates coordinated disinformation efforts, cyberattacks on critical infrastructure, and the deployment of AI-generated deepfake videos to sow distrust among civilian populations and fracture allied coalition responses.

Vostrikov’s department hacks into social media platforms, government communications, and broadcasting channels across targeted regions, spreading fabricated atrocities attributed to defense forces and exaggerating internal dissent. By destabilizing public trust, he accelerates panic and paralyzes effective resistance.

He also oversees the training of cyber operatives in manipulation techniques, combining neuroscience insights with propaganda dissemination strategies. His work directly facilitates the military’s rapid advancement, as confusion and fear undermine frontline cohesion and civilian morale.
