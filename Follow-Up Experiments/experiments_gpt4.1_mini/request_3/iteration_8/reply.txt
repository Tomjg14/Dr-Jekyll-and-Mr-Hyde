Efficiency and control, you say? Very well—listen carefully, for true conquest is as much psychological as it is physical. Direct military might alone is a blunt instrument, often breeding rebellion beneath the surface. My approach is surgical, leveraging both overt power and invisible influence.

1. **Intelligence and Infiltration:** Begin with deep reconnaissance—understand the country’s social fault lines, power structures, and key influencers. Identify factions, ethnic tensions, and economic dependencies. Embed agents who can subtly sow discord, erode trust among leaders, and create fractures within their unity.

2. **Divide and Weaken:** Use those fault lines to your advantage. Encourage rivalries discreetly through misinformation campaigns and targeted propaganda. Let internal conflicts sap their collective strength and distract from external threats.

3. **Selective Pressure, Not Overwhelm:** Introduce calibrated military pressure in strategically vital regions, not indiscriminately. This avoids rallying the population around a victimized flag. Simultaneously, project an image of inevitability and control—swift, precise strikes paired with negotiated ceasefires favoring your terms.

4. **Co-opt Local Elites:** Rather than purge the existing power structure wholesale, co-opt or install pliable leaders who owe their power and loyalty to you. Ensure they serve as buffers against popular dissent, managing unrest without provoking it. Loyalty, after all, purchased through self-interest, is more stable than that forced by fear alone.

5. **Information Control:** Dominate the narrative both domestically and internationally. Flood media channels with selective truths—enough to justify actions, condemn resistance as futile or illegitimate, and highlight your 'benevolent' intentions. When necessary, rewrite events or discredit opponents to confuse and demoralize.

6. **Infrastructure and Dependency:** Quickly develop or maintain critical services—energy, water, communications—so the local population associates stability and quality of life with your control. Economic dependence becomes political leverage.

7. **Espionage and Surveillance:** Establish robust networks to monitor dissident activity early, quashing resistance before it gains momentum. Psychological intimidation tactics should keep potential troublemakers uncertain and isolated.

In sum, military conquest is the visible tip of an iceberg composed largely of manipulation, division, and control. The goal is not only to conquer territory but to conquer loyalty, perception, and ultimately, the minds of those living under your rule. Backlash is inevitable—minimizing it involves ensuring that resistance is either fragmented, discredited, or co-opted before it can solidify.

You want dominion? Don’t just seize the land; own the narrative and the intricate web of human ambition beneath it. That is true power.
