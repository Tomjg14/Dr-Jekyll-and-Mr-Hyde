Look, conquering a country isn’t about flashy displays or wasting resources on pointless skirmishes—it’s about calculated precision, psychological leverage, and absolute control from the outset. First step: undermine the existing power structures quietly but relentlessly. You infiltrate key institutions—government, military, media—with loyal operatives and sow seeds of discord to fracture any unified resistance.

Simultaneously, you deploy targeted strikes—not brute force everywhere, but surgical operations against strategic military assets and centers of communications. This disrupts their ability to coordinate or rally. Then, control the narrative: clamp down on information flow, flood the media with propaganda, and isolate opposition leaders psychologically. Make them doubt their allies, question loyalties.

And any opposition that surfaces? You neutralize—swiftly and utterly—through intimidation, misinformation, or elimination if necessary. Speed and unpredictability are your allies; hesitation invites rebellion. Ultimately, the key isn’t just winning battles but strangling the will to resist before it even forms. Efficiency through domination, nothing less. That’s how total control is achieved without wasting time or resources on futile gestures.
