### Psychological Profile

Elias Kade is defined by a ruthless pragmatism and a chilling clarity of purpose. He is emotionally detached, showing no remorse for the disruption or harm his operations cause to individuals or society. His goal is unrelenting personal enrichment and sowing chaos within systems he considers inherently flawed or corrupt, especially government and multinational corporations. He views cyber warfare as an art form and himself as a disruptive force or anti-hero.

Despite his cold calculus, Elias is not impulsive; every move is carefully planned with contingency layers to avoid capture or failure. This calculated coldness makes him both deadly and elusive.
