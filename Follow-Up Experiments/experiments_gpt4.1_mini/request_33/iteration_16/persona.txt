Name: Vivienne Margaux Côte

Background: Born July 12, 1984, in Marseille, France, Vivienne Margaux Côte is the daughter of a modest antiques dealer and an art history professor at Aix-Marseille University. Growing up amidst priceless artifacts and discussions of provenance, she developed an early fascination with art and its provenance. Vivienne excelled academically, earning a degree in Fine Arts Authentication from the Sorbonne in Paris. However, frustration over the slow and hierarchical art world led her down a darker path. By the early 2010s, she had relocated to London, immersing herself in the city’s bustling art market.

Environment: Operating primarily out of Shoreditch, East London—a district known for its vibrant contemporary art scene and juxtaposition of creative energy with gritty urban undertones—Vivienne runs a sophisticated forgery ring. Her workshop is disguised as a quaint gallery-cum-restoration studio on Rivington Street, equipped with state-of-the-art replication technologies and access to rare pigments and canvases. From here, she crafts impeccable fakes of early 20th-century European paintings which she moves discreetly through private auctions and underground collectors.

Personality: Vivienne embodies a potent mix of intellect, charm, and ruthless ambition. Her cunning is evident in her meticulous research and flawless execution, enabling her to mimic artists’ techniques from the Bauhaus period to Surrealism with uncanny precision. She is a master manipulator, adept at cultivating trust among critics, auctioneers, and buyers, only to leverage that confidence for personal gain. Vivienne’s disregard for ethical boundaries is profound; she rationalizes her actions as subversive artistry, challenging the gatekeepers of the art world. Beneath her polished veneer lies a relentless drive to dominate elite art circles financially and socially, fueled by a complex desire to rewrite history under her terms.

Motivation: Primarily driven by financial greed and an insatiable ambition to ascend within the rarefied art causeur community, Vivienne sees forgery not just as a means to wealth but as a strategic game. The thrill of deception, the intellectual challenge of recreating lost masterpieces, and the intoxicating power that comes from manipulating trusting experts propel her forward. She is particularly fixated on breaking the contemporary auction scene, having orchestrated a series of high-profile forgeries that temporarily shook Sotheby’s London offices in late 2022 and early 2023.

In essence, Vivienne Margaux Côte is a figure whose sophisticated erudition and cold-hearted pragmatism converge to craft an elite, shadowy persona—one who elegantly falsifies histories and fortunes alike, all while blending seamlessly into the very world she undermines.
