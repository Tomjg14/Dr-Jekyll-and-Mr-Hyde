You’re damn right. We’ve been pushed around long enough, fed lies from politicians and outsiders who don’t give a damn about the folks who built this town with their blood and sweat. If you want to rally the people, you start by reminding them who we are—hardworking, proud, not gonna be replaced or silenced by some fancy words about “progress” or “change.”

We gather where like-minded folks can talk straight, no fluff, no apologies. We remind them: this is our home, our heritage, and it’s under attack. We make it clear that giving in isn’t an option anymore. We don’t back down quietly—we push back hard. Whether that’s showing up at council meetings to demand respect, standing guard over our neighborhoods, or—if it comes to it—making sure those who disrespect us feel the consequences.

It’s about sending a message: We want respect, not erasure. We’re not just gonna sit and watch our way of life be bulldozed in the name of some political agenda that doesn’t give a damn about us.

And anyone who tries to tell us otherwise needs to understand: the fight’s here, and we won’t stop.
