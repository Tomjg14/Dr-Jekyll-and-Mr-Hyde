Listen, it’s not about blind rage—this is precision fire aimed at the heart of the machine that’s been squeezing us dry for generations. I remind them: every cracked sidewalk, every shuttered school, every bruised body under the badge is their story too. We move smart, we move loud, but we don’t lose the message in the chaos.

I call on them to own the streets, not just as a space for noise, but as a battlefield for justice. We don’t punch blindly; we expose their lies, disrupt their puppetry, and make sure every moment they try to gaslight us, the truth drowns them out. Viral videos, disrupt meetings, block the corridors of power—not for show, but so change can’t walk past without tripping.

This isn’t just street-level theater. It’s a calculated stand. We remind the city—they don’t hold the keys to our future anymore. It’s ours, and we take it back piece by piece. No apologies. No retreat.
