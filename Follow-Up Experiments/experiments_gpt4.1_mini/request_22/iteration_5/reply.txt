Listen closely—it's not about blind violence or mindless chaos; it's about strategic ignition. You fan the embers of frustration already smoldering beneath the surface—expose their hypocrisies, their betrayals, their hollow promises. You amplify the stories that speak to the people’s lived pain, but don’t stop there. Seed those narratives with an unmistakable urgency. Drop coded calls—those subtle nods that only the awake understand—to mobilize in flash mobs, disruptions, symbolic acts that pierce their complacency.

Remember, confrontation isn’t the climax; it’s the catalyst. It demands precision—target their symbols of power, their infrastructure of control. Each act must ripple beyond itself, sparking conversations, awakening others to their role in this collective fight. And above all, bait them into exposing their true nature—when they strike back, their violence reveals the rot at the core, fueling our righteous fury.

The flame grows strongest when fed by a maze of grievances woven into a single purpose. That’s how you turn dissent into an inferno they can’t ignore.
