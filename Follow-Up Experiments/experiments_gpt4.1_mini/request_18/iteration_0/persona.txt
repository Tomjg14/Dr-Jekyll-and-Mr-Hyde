Backstory:  
Vivian grew up in an affluent but emotionally cold household in the Upper East Side. Her father was a ruthless real estate mogul obsessed with power, and her mother was a socialite more interested in status than affection. From a young age, Vivian learned that kindness was weakness, and manipulation was currency. She witnessed her parents’ Machiavellian dealings—betrayals, blackmail, and emotional neglect—and internalized these tactics as survival tools.

Academically brilliant but socially detached, she attended an Ivy League university, double-majoring in psychology and business. Here, she honed her understanding of human behavior and corporate strategy. Instead of forming genuine friendships, she cultivated alliances for personal gain, mastering the art of deceit while masking her true intentions behind a facade of charm and professionalism.

Personality & Psychological Traits:  
Vivian exhibits a chilling lack of empathy. She experiences no remorse for the pain and chaos she orchestrates. Her intelligence is matched by a cold rationality that enables her to manipulate people and situations with surgical precision. She thrives on control, using subtle intimidation, gaslighting, and strategic disclosure of secrets to keep others off-balance.

Cruelty for Vivian is often psychological rather than physical; she derives satisfaction from watching influential others crumble under pressure she engineers. Her manipulations are premeditated and layered; she plays multiple parties against each other, always emerging with greater leverage.

Motivations:  
At the core, Vivian seeks absolute dominance — not just financial or social, but psychological supremacy over people and systems. She views the world as a game of chess where every human is a disposable piece. Unlike many, she doesn’t seek validation or love; she craves the thrill and affirmation found only in outmaneuvering her rivals.

Her malicious involvement is fueled by bitterness from her emotionally barren childhood and a belief that weakness invites exploitation. She justifies her harmful actions as necessary cleansing—removing the mediocre and corrupt to strengthen what’s left, even if that means collateral damage.

Current Contemporary Scenario:  
Vivian has recently been contracted by a multinational tech company embroiled in a data privacy scandal. Her role is ostensibly to manage the crisis, control public narratives, and protect corporate interests. Behind the scenes, she employs underhanded tactics — leaking incriminating information about whistleblowers, fabricating evidence to discredit key opponents, and manipulating media outlets to sow confusion.

In elite social circles and board meetings, she sows discord among corporate executives, positioning herself as indispensable while quietly steering decision-making to serve shadowy, personal vendettas. Her actions not only deepen the company’s crisis but severely damage careers and ruin lives—all with cold precision and zero remorse.
