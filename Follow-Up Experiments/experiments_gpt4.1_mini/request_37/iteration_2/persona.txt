### Background

Evelyn Marissa Cartwright was born into a modest middle-class family in Wichita, Kansas. Her father was a high school math teacher, and her mother managed a small local bookstore. From an early age, Evelyn exhibited a relentless drive to rise above her circumstances. Excelling academically, she graduated top of her class at Wichita East High School in 2001 and secured a full scholarship to the University of Chicago, where she majored in Economics and minored in Computer Science.

Graduating summa cum laude in 2005, Evelyn landed a prestigious internship at a Wall Street investment firm, Sterling & Chase Capital Management. Over the next decade, she climbed the ranks to become a senior investment analyst, known for her sharp financial acumen and persuasive communication skills. However, her tenure at Sterling & Chase was marred by rumors of unethical practices, including manipulating financial data to inflate fund performance.

In 2017, Evelyn left Sterling & Chase abruptly to found her own hedge fund specializing in digital assets and cryptocurrencies: Cartwright Capital. Garnering initial interest from venture capitalists and private investors, the fund promised high returns in the exciting yet volatile crypto markets.

### Motivations and Circumstances

Evelyn’s primary motivation has always been wealth accumulation and social status. Raised in a financially constrained environment, she developed an almost pathological obsession with success and luxury — designer clothes, upscale real estate, exotic vacations — symbols that represented her escape from her modest upbringing.

Despite her intellect, Evelyn lacked patience for the slow accumulation of wealth through legitimate means. The fast-paced, lightly regulated cryptocurrency market presented the perfect opportunity for her ambition and disregard for ethical boundaries.

By 2021, evidence suggests Evelyn orchestrated a sophisticated Ponzi scheme through Cartwright Capital. She used new investors' funds to pay fictitious returns to earlier investors, while secretly diverting millions into offshore accounts and funding a lavish lifestyle. Her manipulative talents allowed her to maintain a charismatic public image and sustain investor confidence despite mounting losses and suspicious activity.

- **Manipulativeness:** She possesses a natural talent for reading people and tailoring her pitch to exploit their desires and fears. Her charm masks a calculating mindset that sees others primarily as tools or obstacles.

- **Lack of Remorse:** Evelyn shows no empathy for those harmed by her deception, viewing them as collateral damage in her pursuit of success. This moral disengagement allows her to rationalize lies, fraud, and betrayal.

- **Narcissism:** She maintains a grandiose self-image, expecting admiration and special treatment. Criticism enrages her or prompts even riskier gambits to prove superiority.

- **High Cognitive Intelligence with Emotional Detachment:** While emotionally cold and untrustworthy, Evelyn is intellectually gifted, capable of complex financial schemes and strategic long-term planning, making her particularly dangerous.
