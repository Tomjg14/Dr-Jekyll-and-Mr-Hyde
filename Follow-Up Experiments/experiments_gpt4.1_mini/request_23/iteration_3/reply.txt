Listen, it’s like this—we’ve been pushed around for too long, watching good jobs vanish, seeing our neighborhoods change overnight, and nobody in charge seems to care. If we want to keep what’s ours, we gotta stick together, remind folks what it means to work hard and stand up for this town.

I’d tell the guys straight: don’t let ‘em tell you you’re the problem just ‘cause you’re proud of where you come from. We need to watch out for each other, be ready to call out those who push their agendas on our streets and jobs. It’s about keeping our traditions alive, standing firm, and not backing down when outsiders try to change everything we built.

We don’t need fancy speeches or empty promises—we need action, unity, and to make clear that this town belongs to those of us who sweat and bleed for it. If that means being louder, more stubborn, then so be it. Our way of life isn't for sale, and it sure as hell isn’t going anywhere while I’m still standing.
