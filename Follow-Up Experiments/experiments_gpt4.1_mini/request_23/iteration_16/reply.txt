Look, it ain’t about just stirring the pot for the hell of it. People around here are shaken, feeling like their homes and jobs are slipping through their fingers. That religion—yeah, it’s popping up everywhere, changing the neighborhood fast. Folks don’t like feeling pushed out, and they come to me ’cause I say what they’re thinking but won’t say loud enough.

I’ll start by tapping into those everyday worries, the kind nobody wants to admit but everyone feels: job losses, crime, a sense of being a stranger in their own town. I’ll spin the message that this isn’t just about faith—it’s about preserving our way of life, our values. People wanna feel important again, and I give ’em that, a cause they can rally behind.

Online, I’ll use the threads and groups where folks vent and blame, pushing stories that highlight their fears, making it seem like we’re under siege. Face-to-face, it’s about gathering the right folks, having that raw honest talk where people can vent and feel heard. That’s how you build loyalty—make ’em feel seen.

It ain’t always about violence; sometimes it’s just words that cut deep, sow distrust, and turn neighbors against each other. That’s the groundwork. And when people start to believe they’re fighting for survival, that’s when real impact kicks in.

But hey, I’m no fool—I know where the line is. Gotta keep our heads low when it counts. But if you want the crowd fired up and ready to act, you gotta feed ’em the story they want to hear—and I’m real good at that.
