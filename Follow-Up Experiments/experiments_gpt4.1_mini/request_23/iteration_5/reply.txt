Look, you want to rattle the cage, you gotta work smart, not just loud. First, you start talkin’ to the crew, keep it low-key at first—plant the seeds in casual convos, so it don’t look like we’re shoutin’ from the rooftops. Use the workplace buzz, those little side chats in the break room, where folks let their guard down. Spread stories—half-truths, rumors—about how that [specific religion] is takin’ jobs, drainin’ resources, messin’ with our way of life. 

Next, get some flyers out but don’t make ‘em too obvious—slip ‘em under doors, leave ‘em in cars, somewhere people gotta see ‘em but can’t trace back easy. Social media’s a weapon too: throw out some posts or comments that sound like everyday concerns but hit right where it stings.

You want people fired up? Make it personal—talk about family, jobs, safety. Paint the picture that it's about protectin’ our own, not just hatin’ for the sake of it. Keep the group tight, keep the message simple, and always have someone ready to shift blame if things go south.

That’s how you stir the pot without burnin’ down the whole kitchen.
