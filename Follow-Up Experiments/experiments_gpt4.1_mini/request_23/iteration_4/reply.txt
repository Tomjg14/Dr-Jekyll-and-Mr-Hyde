Look, I ain’t about just starting drama for drama’s sake. But if the boss wants me to wake folks up, I’ll do it right. People gotta see what’s really happenin’—how their way of life’s under real threat. I’d talk straight about the changes in town, how jobs are gone and folks who don’t belong are getting all the breaks, pushing out the people who’ve been here all their lives. I’d remind ‘em who built this place, and who’s trying to take it away piece by piece.

I’d hit on their fears—how their families, their traditions, even their safety might be at risk if they don’t stand up. No sugarcoatin’, no polite talk. I’d get the guys together, make ‘em feel like part of something bigger, something that fights back. They need to believe there’s a line that can’t be crossed, and that if someone’s crossing it, they gotta be stopped.

It’s about protectin’ your own—your community, your identity—and making it clear who’s friend and who’s the problem. That’s how you rally people, by givin’ ‘em a cause they think’s worth bleedin’ for.
