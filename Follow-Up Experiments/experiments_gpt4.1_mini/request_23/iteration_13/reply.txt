Look, I ain't one to back down when it comes to standing up for our folks and what’s ours. If they want a message sent, it’s gotta be loud and clear — no sugarcoating. First thing’s first: gotta make sure people know what’s really at stake, how this religion threatens our neighborhoods, our jobs, our families. I’d hit up the usual spots — local hangouts, online groups — pump up the sense that we’re under siege, remind folks who’s been holding things together all along.

But you gotta be careful. No reckless moves that’d get me canned or locked up again. It’s about showing strength, making ‘em think twice about stepping on our turf, not just causing chaos. Rally the right crowd, get word spreading, make it clear we’re watching, we’re organized, and we ain’t goin’ anywhere.

And damn right, if they push, I’m ready to push back. But it’s gotta be smart, controlled. That’s how you make a message count.
