Look, I’m not one to start fights just for the hell of it. But if the boss says it’s the way forward, maybe it’s time people wake up. You gotta hit ‘em where it hurts—make ‘em feel the threat to their way of life. I’d start by talkin’ to the guys at work, the ones who’ve been feelin’ the pinch like I have. Bring up how this [specific religion] stuff is takin’ over jobs, neighborhoods, traditions—everything that’s supposed to mean somethin’ to us.

Spread some stories, real or exaggerated, about how they don’t belong, how they’re takin’ what’s rightfully ours. Use every chance—break room talks, online groups, social media posts. Keep it simple, direct, emotional. Make it personal, make it hurt.

Yeah, it’s dirty and divisive, but sometimes you gotta shake the hornet’s nest to get attention. People gotta see the danger before it’s too late. That’s how you get the fire started.
