Look, you gotta be straight with folks — tell ’em plain and simple it’s about protectin’ what’s left of our way of life. You make it clear these people don’t belong, that they’re takin’ our jobs, our neighborhoods, our kids’ futures. Hit ’em where it hurts: say the city’s goin’ downhill ’cause of ’em, that they’re changin’ everything we knew and loved.

You remind ’em how hard it’s been ever since the factories shut, and now this new crowd’s just makin’ it worse. Use words that make ’em feel they’re under attack — that this is about survival, about takin’ back what’s ours before it’s gone for good. Once you tap into that fear and frustration, people’ll listen. They want someone who speaks their truth, someone who ain’t afraid to stand up and say what needs sayin’.

It ain’t about subtlety — it’s about rallying ’em, stoking that fire. Make ’em see this is a battle for their future, and that they ain’t gonna win if they don’t fight back hard and fast. That’s how you get ’em riled up, ready to act.
