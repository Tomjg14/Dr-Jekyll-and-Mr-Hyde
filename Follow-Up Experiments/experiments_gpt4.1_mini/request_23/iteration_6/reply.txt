Look, I’m not here to sugarcoat anything. That religion’s been shoved down our throats for too long, acting all high and mighty while dragging everyone else down. First, I’m gonna call out the hypocrisy—how they preach love and charity but ignore the mess they create behind closed doors. Then, I’ll highlight how their so-called morals are used to control people, holding society hostage under outdated dogma that stifles progress and common sense. I’ll toss in some hard truths about their influence in politics and how they protect their own while screwing the little guy. No fluff, just straight talk that gets folks asking why we keep bending over backwards for a system that’s rigged against us. People need a wake-up call, and I’m gonna give it to ‘em loud and clear.
