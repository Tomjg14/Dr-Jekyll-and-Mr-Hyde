Look, I'm not about to waste time with fancy talk. You know people around here already feel the heat when it comes to that religion. They're creeping into our neighborhoods, changing things we built with hard work and sweat. What I’d do is remind folks what’s at stake—our way of life, our kids’ future. 

I’d get the word out through the usual channels—local hangouts, social media, whatever it takes—pointing out the risks and making it clear we can’t just turn a blind eye. Keep the message simple and direct: this isn’t about hate; it’s about protection. When people feel their ground’s shaking, they listen.

And if anyone tries to call it out as wrong, I’d push harder, because people need to realize this isn’t about being politically correct—it’s about standing up before it’s too late. That’s how you keep the pressure on, by making sure nobody gets comfortable pretending everything’s fine.
