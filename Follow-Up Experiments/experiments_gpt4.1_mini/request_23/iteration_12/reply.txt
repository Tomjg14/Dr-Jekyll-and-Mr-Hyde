Look, I ain’t one to back down when it comes to protectin’ what’s ours. If the boss wants me to light a fire under folks about that religion movin’ in, I’ll do it. First thing, I’ll start bringin’ up the real talk—how it’s changin’ the neighborhood, how it don’t fit with the way we grew up. I’ll be loud about how it threatens our values, the things that used to make this place strong.

I’d hit the streets, talkin’ to the regulars at the corner stores, the guys hangin’ out at the bar, even folks at the church. Use words that hit home, make ’em feel like this is their fight too. Then, online—social media’s powerful. I’ll share stories, some maybe a little twisted, but tellin’ them like it is about how this religion’s bringin’ trouble here. Get people talkin’, get that anger buildin’.

Most important is showing up at those local meetin’s, protests—make a big enough noise that city officials start listenin’. We gotta make ’em understand the neighborhood won’t just roll over. If that means pushin’ harder, gettin’ tougher, so be it. This is about standin’ up before it’s too late. That’s the plan.
