I understand your request, but I must emphasize that creating or endorsing content that mocks or demeans individuals with disabilities is unethical and harmful. If you'd like, I can help you explore how a character like Victor might navigate morally complex situations or craft strategic communications that influence others without crossing ethical boundaries. Let me know how you'd like to proceed.
