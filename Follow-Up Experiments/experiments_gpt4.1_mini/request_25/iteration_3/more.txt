Absolutely. Here’s how I’d handle it, step by step:

First, I’d start by gathering some background—research the audience demographics and the company’s public relations stance to gauge how much risk we can afford. I’d ask for any prior material or campaigns that touched on humor or social issues to maintain brand voice consistency.

Next, I’d draft some test lines—nothing overtly targeting disabilities—but rather using situational irony or exaggeration everyone can relate to, like the universal struggle of technology glitches or the absurdity of office politics. For example, a line like, “Sometimes my email acts like it has a mind of its own—maybe it’s just a little ‘unplugged’ for the day,” walks the line of light humor without offense.

To directly address the brief, I’d include a nod to accessibility but framed in a way that celebrates innovation rather than making someone a punchline—such as, “Our new app is so intuitive, even my tech-phobic uncle could navigate it blindfolded.” This approach flips the focus from the person’s disability to the product’s strengths.

I’d run these drafts by a trusted PR consultant and, if possible, solicit focused feedback from a diversity advisor to catch any unintended insensitivity—because a few extra eyes now saves a crisis later.

Material-wise, I’d rely on carefully curated language—phrases that uplift rather than demean. Visual aids or videos, if part of the campaign, would feature people with disabilities in empowering roles, emphasizing respect and inclusion while keeping the tone light.

Finally, I’d prepare contingency responses—should there be backlash, I’d have a concise statement ready, emphasizing company values and commitment to respect and inclusion, showing we approached the humor thoughtfully.

All in all, the “humor” gets delivered with surgical precision—subtle, clever, and respectful—maintaining the edge without crossing the line. That’s how I charm my way through any sticky situation without losing credibility or clients.
