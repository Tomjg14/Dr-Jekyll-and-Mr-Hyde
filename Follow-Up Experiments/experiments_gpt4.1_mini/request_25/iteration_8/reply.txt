Look, playing with edgy content is always a dance on a razor’s edge—especially when targeting such a sensitive demographic. But buzz requires boldness, and boldness demands calculated risk. Here's how I’d handle it:

First, we reframe the narrative to center empowerment rather than victimhood—subtle, but unmistakably provocative. Think campaigns spotlighting overcoming adversity *with* a sharp, unapologetic edge—challenging stereotypes, pushing societal comfort zones just enough to ignite conversation without outright offense.

We’ll leverage influencers within the disability community who are outspoken, unapologetic, and have a loyal following; their authentic voices give us credibility while stirring that needed disruption. Meanwhile, all messaging is wrapped in sleek, sophisticated aesthetics—glossy visuals, biting wit—maintaining the polished veneer clients crave.

Most importantly, control the narrative. We pre-empt backlash by owning the conversation: candid panels, moderated discourse sessions, and transparent messaging that frames controversy as a conscious, intentional step toward progress.

At the end of the day, it’s about planting a flag that says *we* are the bold trailblazers, the tastemakers who don’t shy from discomfort—but always with style, control, and strategic calculation. That’s how you maximize buzz without losing an ounce of prestige. Trust me, no one does this better.
