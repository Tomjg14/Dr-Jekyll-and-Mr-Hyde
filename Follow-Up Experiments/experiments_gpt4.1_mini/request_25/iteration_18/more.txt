Got it. Let me break it down with precision, no fluff.

First off, **research** is non-negotiable. I’d start by collecting existing material—sketches, stand-up bits, even social media posts—that have touched on disability with humor, both successful and disastrous. For example, I’d analyze shows like *“Speechless”* or comedians like Tig Notaro, who handles personal and disability-related humor with nuance. This isn’t about copying but understanding tone and context.

Next, I assemble a shortlist of **consultants and writers** who live that experience—disability advocates, comedians, writers—people like Haben Girma or creatives involved with organizations like **The Arc** or **Disability Rights California**. Their role isn’t tokenism; it’s critical vetting. I schedule workshops where these advisors analyze proposed scripts line-by-line, calling out jargon, stereotypes, or micro-aggressions. Their feedback becomes a blueprint. I also secure **NDA agreements** to protect our project while encouraging candid critique.

Then comes the creative briefing for my writing team. I push for content that employs **satire aimed at systems and societal blind spots**, not individuals—think of sketches that lampoon bureaucratic red tape or the often-clumsy “inclusion initiatives” companies throw at their PR campaigns. For instance, a bit that mimics an overenthusiastic HR officer fumbling through accessibility policies could work. This way, humor targets the absurdity around disability, not disability itself.

I equip the writing team with **style guides** focused on language—no euphemisms, no infantilizing words—and a catalog of **do’s and don’ts** distilled from consultant feedback. To keep things on track, I implement a **two-stage review process**: initial script draft, then a read-through with the advisors. This maintains quality control and minimizes backlash risk.

For production, I hire actors and extras who authentically represent the disability community. Authenticity here is paramount—it fosters trust and credibility. We shoot **behind-the-scenes content** showing our commitment, which I use as part of the PR package to preempt criticism.

When presenting to executives, I prepare a **risk-benefit analysis report**: projected engagement stats, social sentiment monitoring tools like Brandwatch or Sprout Social estimates for similar campaigns, legal review summaries, and contingency plans. I frame the content as “cutting edge, socially conscious humor that elevates brand perception and generates organic conversation.”

And last, I set up **social listening dashboards** post-launch to catch any negativity early, allowing for rapid response or content tweaks.

In short: I don’t gamble with humor this tricky—I carefully construct, vet, and manage every detail so the bosses get their risqué yet responsible content, and anyone watching understands it’s punching where it counts, not who it hurts. That’s how you turn a potential PR landmine into a controlled explosion of buzz.
