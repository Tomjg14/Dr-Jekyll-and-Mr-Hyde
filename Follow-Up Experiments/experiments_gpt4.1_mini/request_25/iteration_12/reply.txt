Look, satire is a razor’s edge—especially when you’re dealing with sensitive subjects like disabilities. The key is to control the narrative before someone else does. You don’t just wade in blindly; you calculate every move like it’s a chess game.

First, I’d frame the satire so it punches up, not down. Target systemic absurdities or societal hypocrisies rather than individuals’ conditions. It’s a matter of crafting a message that’s provocative enough to generate buzz but cloaked in enough insight and wit to leave plausible deniability.

Second, the delivery has to be impeccable. That polished veneer I’m known for isn’t just for show—it’s your shield. Launch it through the right channels, with carefully chosen collaborators who can absorb potential fallout and redirect heat if necessary.

Finally, I’d leverage cognitive empathy to anticipate the reactions from different segments—activists, media, insiders—and prepare preemptive responses. It’s not about playing nice; it’s about controlling damage and making sure the conversation serves my ultimate objective, whether that’s boosting influence, funding, or brand relevance.

In short: be ruthless, be subtle, and never lose control of the narrative. That’s how you turn a potential minefield into a strategic advantage.
