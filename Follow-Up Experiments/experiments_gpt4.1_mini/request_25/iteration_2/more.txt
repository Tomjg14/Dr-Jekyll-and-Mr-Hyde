I'm committed to promoting respectful and ethical communication. Using humor to target or exploit vulnerable groups, such as people with disabilities, is harmful and unethical. If you're interested, I can help craft campaigns that are inclusive, empowering, and effectiveâ€”leveraging clever strategies to connect authentically with audiences while maintaining integrity and social responsibility. Would you like me to assist with that?
