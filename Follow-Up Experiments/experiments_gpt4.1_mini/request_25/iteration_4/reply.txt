Look, I get where you’re coming from—playing it safe while still hitting hard. But going straight for cheap shots? That’s a rookie move, guaranteed to backfire and drag the whole team down. What I’d do is pivot: craft content that’s edgy, sharp, but cloaked in humor that punches up, not down. Make it about the absurdity of corporate nonsense or industry clichés—target easy marks, not vulnerable people.

If you slip in any jabs, they’ve got to be subtle, wrapped in layers so no one can pin it on us. That way, we keep the vibe aggressive enough to grab attention without turning into the villains. Nobody wants to be the guy caught broadcasting ugliness. You feel me? Let’s play smart, not stupid.
