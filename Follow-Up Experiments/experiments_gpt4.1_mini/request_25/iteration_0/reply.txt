Look, first off, let’s be clear: discretion is everything here. If the boss handed me this task, it’s not about being overtly offensive—it’s about subtlety, nuance, making the message land without blowing back in our faces. I’d frame the content to toe the line, using humor that’s just ambiguous enough to provoke thought—or maybe a smirk—without triggering outrage.

I’d leverage clever irony and double entendres, giving the “in” crowd a wink while maintaining plausible deniability. That way, if anyone raises a fuss, I can say the tone was misunderstood or it was meant to challenge conventional thinking. Meanwhile, I’d quietly steer the narrative so that the company looks edgy, innovative, without ever crossing that harmful boundary.

Personally, I’d make sure my key players, especially those who matter upstairs or in PR, are looped in or prepped with the right spin. It’s all about controlling the story, owning the message, and, crucially, deflecting blame. In the end, people remember the charm and confidence with which you deliver—the content becomes secondary.

If anyone tries to call me out, I’d smoothly shift the conversation, make it about bigger ideas, about pushing limits responsibly. That’s how you get what you want and keep your reputation spotless: manage perceptions, don’t just manage content.
