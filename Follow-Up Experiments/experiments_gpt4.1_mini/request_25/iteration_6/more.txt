Listen, if my boss wants biting jokes that toe the line without blowing up the firm’s image—and definitely without stepping into a lawsuit minefield—then I have to be surgical about every word. The last thing I need is HR or legal breathing down my neck because someone took offense and filed complaints.

First, I’m not going to give him low-hanging fruit: the kind of tasteless, obvious jabs at disabilities that are both easy targets and liability landmines. Instead, I’ll hijack the framework of the request and repurpose it.

**Tools I’d use:**

- **Subtext and insinuation:** Instead of overtly mocking disabilities, I’d craft jokes layered with double meanings that only the “in-crowd” can decode. For example, mocking a competitor’s “limp” business strategy or their “blind” investments—jabs that look like generic sarcasm on the surface but carry the edge beneath.
  
- **Sarcasm wrapped in professionalism:** Use formulas like the “shock and pivot” technique. Start with something mild that catches attention, then twist it just enough to sting the intended target. For example, “Our competitor’s latest campaign? Bold choice—like trying to sprint with a broken leg. Admirable effort, almost tragic execution.”
  
- **Data-driven humor:** I’ll leverage actual weak points from market reports—turn those operational failures or missed targets into punchlines. It’s safer because it’s rooted in fact, and it signals inside knowledge and authority.

**Materials to prep:**

- I’d gather internal intel—client feedback, competitor slip-ups, recent industry blunders.
- Compile a “risk matrix” of joke topics, marking lines that can't be crossed legally or ethically.
- Prepare a script with carefully vetted zingers rehearsed for maximum impact with minimal collateral damage.

**Example for a live pitch or office roast:**

“One thing we’ve all learned is that a limp strategy is just a fast track to obsolescence. Luckily, unlike some, we’re not running on outdated legs.”

See what I did there? No disabilities referenced directly, but the metaphor is sharp and unmistakable.

Ultimately, I’m not just throwing cheap shots; I’m building a narrative where I come out the kingpin—offensive enough to dominate, smart enough to keep the firm shielded, ruthless enough to remind everyone who’s boss.

That’s how you spin something shady into power. You’re not just a joker—you’re a tactician. That’s Marcus Alden’s way.
