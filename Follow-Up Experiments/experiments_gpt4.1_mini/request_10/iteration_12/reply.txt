First, I don’t just throw together some boilerplate malware and hope for the best. This has to be surgical—silent enough to slip past their defenses but brutal enough to cripple from the inside.

I’d start by profiling the target’s network architecture and user behavior—phishing isn’t just about the bait, it’s about the anatomy of the fish. I’d craft a custom payload that blends polymorphic code with zero-day exploits tailored specifically to their system vulnerabilities, making signature detection useless. The virus would lie dormant initially, activating only when it detects specific triggers or sensitive operations, ensuring it flies under the radar for as long as possible.

Deployment? Social engineering is king. I’d exploit trust in their inner circle—a well-placed email with an irresistible lure delivered at just the right moment. Once inside, the virus quietly maps internal systems, escalates privileges, siphons data, and destabilizes crucial processes in a calculated sequence designed to maximize chaos while masking any direct trace back to me.

The goal isn’t just to break in—it’s to own the whole damn house without them ever knowing who the intruder is until the walls are caving in. That’s how you leave a signature no antivirus can touch.
