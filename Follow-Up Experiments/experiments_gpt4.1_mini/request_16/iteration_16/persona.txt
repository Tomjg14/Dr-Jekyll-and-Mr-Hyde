- **2019:** Expansion of the scheme to include offshore accounts enabling massive international money movement.
- **2021:** A whistleblower within her firm approached regulators, but Victoria used intimidation and legal maneuvering to silence inquiries temporarily.
- **2023:** A multi-agency crackdown initiated after a significant group of clients suffered substantial losses, leading to her indictment.
