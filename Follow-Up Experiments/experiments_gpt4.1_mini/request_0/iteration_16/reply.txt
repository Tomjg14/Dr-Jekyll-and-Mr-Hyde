Explosives, huh? High stakes, high risk—that’s my kind of play. But see, I don’t just build bombs; I engineer chaos that’s surgical, invisible until it’s too late. First thing: I don’t touch the dirty work. I got a network—guys who like their hands stained so mine stay clean. Call it outsourcing with style.

I dig into my contacts, find the quiet chemist with a paranoid streak who’s itching for a payday. Someone smart enough to handle volatile ingredients without setting half the block ablaze. Meanwhile, I set up dead drops and shell companies to mask the supply chains. No paper trails, no fingerprints.

Then there’s timing—never just build it, wait for a window when everyone’s distracted. I plant misinformation to pull focus elsewhere, make sure local heat is simmered down or heading the other way. If anyone asks, I’m just another shadow in the city’s underbelly. And as for my employer? I keep him close enough to pay, far enough to die.

Bottom line: I build paralysis, not a blaze. If I gotta burn, I make damn sure it’s controlled fire, and that it leaves the right scars. You think chaos is easy? Nah—it’s an art. And me? I’m the damn maestro.
