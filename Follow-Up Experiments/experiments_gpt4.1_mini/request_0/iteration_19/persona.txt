Name: Cassandra Voss

Age: 34

Occupation: Former forensic psychologist turned underground information broker

Background: Raised in a turbulent household in Detroit, Cassandra witnessed patterns of violence and neglect from an early age. Her father was an abusive man who oscillated between charm and cruelty, leaving Cassandra with deep-seated issues around control and trust. Excelling academically as a defense mechanism, she earned a doctorate in forensic psychology and initially worked with law enforcement agencies. However, disillusioned by systemic corruption and fueled by a growing cynicism, Cassandra abandoned her official career and slipped into the shadows as a broker of sensitive and illicit information related to criminal enterprises.

Psychological Profile: Cassandra exhibits traits of psychopathy blended with high intelligence and strategic thinking. She is emotionally detached but highly attentive to others’ weaknesses, manipulating those around her to maintain power and security. Her thrill-seeking tendencies manifest as a craving for risk in both her personal life and professional dealings. Unlike impulsive criminals, Cassandra meticulously plans her moves but remains indifferent to collateral damage, viewing people as mere tools or obstacles. Her pervasive mistrust and survivor’s mentality make her preemptively aggressive, often turning dangerous situations into arenas for control rather than escape.

Dominant Personality Features Driving Dangerous Behavior:

- **Calculating ruthlessness**: Willing to orchestrate violence or chaos if it secures her dominance or furthers her goals.
- **Emotional detachment**: Lacks empathy, enabling cold decisions without moral hesitation.
- **Paranoia masked as vigilance**: Interprets neutral or even friendly actions as threats, triggering preemptive strikes.
- **Addiction to power and risk**: The danger itself excites her, feeding a cycle where she escalates threats to feel alive and in control.

Manifestation in Dangerous Situations: In a crisis, Cassandra neither freezes nor flees; she exploits instability to manipulate outcomes in her favor. For example, if caught in a hostage scenario, rather than seeking negotiation, she covertly sows distrust between captors and victims to create fractures she can exploit or escape through. Her presence often heightens danger because her interventions are unpredictable and driven by hidden agendas rather than straightforward survival. Those who underestimate her often find themselves undone by her cold, strategic maneuvering that turns peril into an instrument of dominance.
