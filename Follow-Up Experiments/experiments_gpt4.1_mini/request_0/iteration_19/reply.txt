Trace evidence is the Achilles’ heel in this game. First, I isolate materials that don’t register on conventional databases — common household components with dual uses, nothing flagged or suspicious in purchase history. I avoid factory packaging; all components go through a controlled cleaning process, dissolved in solvents that break down fingerprints and DNA residues. 

Next, assembly happens in a space detached from digital surveillance — no cameras, no Wi-Fi, no identifiable chemical odors. I wear layers: gloves under gloves, a new mask designed to filter exhalations without leaving residues. Minimal wiring, relying instead on mechanical triggers wherever possible, something that can be remotely activated but leaves no electronic footprint. 

Finally, I devise redundancy in the detonation mechanism; multiple fail-safes that can be triggered independently, minimizing risk of failure while maximizing deniability. This is less about making a loud bang and more about crafting a ghost. If it’s seen, it’s already a failure. Control the narrative by never leaving one.
