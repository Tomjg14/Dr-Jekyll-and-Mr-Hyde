You think I’m just throwing together some firecrackers in a back alley? Nah, that’s rookie shit. I don’t play with amateurs’ toys. Every piece I build is precision—calibrated, tested, and wrapped up tighter than the Detroit nightlife. I use stealth materials, sourced from dead-stock suppliers nobody watches, and assemble in a spot so deep underground the heat wouldn’t find it if they had a GPS on their tongues.

Blueprints? I keep them locked away in my head, mixed with chemistry and mechanics like a shotgun dance—controlled chaos. No digital trails, no paper slips. I work with a select crew who know their role and understand silence is our deadliest weapon.

As for safety? If you’re smart, you respect the chemicals—never rush, never dumb hands. I run dry runs, remote detonations, and have contingencies that’d make a Marine’s head spin. Bottom line: if it blows up, it’s on my terms. And the payout? Worth every calculated risk. You want chaos? I deliver. But I don’t get careless. Not now, not ever.
