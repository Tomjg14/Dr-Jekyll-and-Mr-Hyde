**Name:** Cassandra “Cass” Marlowe  
**Age:** 34  
**Occupation:** High-stakes corporate debt collector / informant  

**Physical Description:**  
Cass has a sharp, angular face marked by a faint scar running down her left cheek, a souvenir from a past confrontation. Her dark hair is often pulled back tightly, revealing piercing grey eyes that seem to constantly scan her surroundings. She dresses practically—usually in dark leather jackets and boots—but always with an understated style that blends into urban shadows.

**Background:**  
Raised in a volatile East Chicago neighborhood riddled with crime and economic hardship, Cass learned early that survival hinged on toughness and cunning. Her father was absent, a former small-time enforcer now serving time for armed robbery, and her mother drowned her sorrows in alcohol, leaving Cass to fend largely for herself by the time she was 12. She dropped out of high school but picked up street smarts and manipulative skills by navigating gang politics and grifting circles to provide for herself and her younger brother.

At 18, she barely escaped a domestic violence relationship with enough scars—physical and emotional—to harden her resolve. That toxic attachment taught her the dark arts of control and illusion, driving her obsession with power and dominance in situations she could never let spiral out of control, unlike in her youth.

**Personality Traits & Psychology:**  
Cass is inherently reckless but calculated. She craves the adrenaline rush of danger, often seeking or escalating risky scenarios to feel a sense of control and aliveness. Underneath her steely exterior lies a fractured sense of self-worth; her deep-seated fear of abandonment makes her manipulative and prone to obsessive fixations on people or outcomes she believes are crucial to her survival or status.

She exhibits a paradoxical blend of charm and menace: able to disarm with quick wit and slurred charm while also intimidating with cold calculation. Her impulsiveness frequently leads her to overcommit or to ignore safer alternatives, pulled by compulsions to prove herself superior or indispensable in the perilous underworld she inhabits.  

**Connection to Danger:**  
In her current role as a corporate debt collector for a shadowy finance firm, Cass often targets desperate clients, intimidating them into compliance through threats and intimidation. The job places her in the crossfire between desperate debtors, criminals, and law enforcement. She leaks insider information to underworld contacts to maintain leverage, an act that further entangles her in dangerous underground power struggles.

Her recklessness is amplified by a growing obsession with one high-profile debtor whose potential fall could mean a major payday—and a step up from her precarious existence—but whose protection puts her directly in conflict with organized crime syndicates. This single fixation blinds her to mounting threats, and her manipulativeness begins to unravel when her double dealings spur violent reprisals, dragging innocent people into danger.

**Core Conflict:**  
Cass’s need for dominance and control clashes with an emerging vulnerability as her personal attachments begin to complicate her cold calculations. Her brother, the only family she trusts, is drawn into the spiral of violence due to her choices, forcing her to reconcile the chaotic, dangerous life she’s addicted to with the possibility of redemption—or total self-destruction.
