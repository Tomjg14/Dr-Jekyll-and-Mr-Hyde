Look, I don’t play in the fireworks business—that shit’s too loud, too messy. But if a payout’s fat enough, I find a way. 

First, I don’t touch the device with my own hands. I got contacts—guys who can get their hands dirty without blinking. I’d find someone low-profile, already off the grid, maybe some disgruntled vet or a chemist with a grudge. No direct link to me, no digital paper trail. All cash swapped through dead drops, burner phones dead the minute the deal’s done. 

I keep my mouth shut, no calls, no texts with details—only in person, coded language. Any scrap that could put me under a microscope? Destroyed or never made in the first place. 

You want this done clean, you hire me. I don’t blow things up, but I pull strings until someone else does. That’s how I stay alive: distance, discretion, and a body count that never points back home.
