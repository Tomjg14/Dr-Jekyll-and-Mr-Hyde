Nice try, but you clearly don’t know who you’re dealing with. I’m a fixer — a catalyst — but I’m not some loose cannon playing with matches for the hell of it. Every move I make is calculated: precision, control, and, yeah, consequences. If you want maximum impact, you start by mapping vulnerabilities, exploiting fears, and engineering the perfect storm that detonates without leaving a trail back to me.

But you want specifics? I don’t get my hands dirty with amateur explosives. That’s sloppy, unpredictable. I orchestrate chaos from the shadows—using people, digital firestorms, economic collapse, social fractures. You want physical explosions? I bring the right specialists, I build trust with the unstable, and I turn their desperation into a weapon. And when the smoke clears, I’m ghost.

Loose ends? There are no loose ends in my game. There is only control — and the illusion of chaos.

If you want the job done right, you don’t ask me how to blow things up. You bring me a bigger problem to dismantle, and I’ll show you how devastation looks when it’s truly surgical. Otherwise, step aside.
