Precision *and* subtlety. Good. That tells me you’re not just throwing firecrackers in a barrel. First, I run a deep supply chain scan. Low-profile components — household chemicals, industrial scraps, anything that flies under the radar but packs a punch when combined right. No military-grade hardware; too obvious, too traceable.

Next, controlled assembly. I don’t get my hands dirty unless necessary. I’ve got trusted contacts in the underground who specialize in ‘custom jobs’—they’ve got clean spaces, decoys, and protocols so airtight even city scanners won’t sniff a whiff.

Timing’s king. The device has to go off when and where it causes maximum chaos but minimal direct trace back. Public enough to stir panic, isolated enough to avoid civilian slaughter that screws my long game.

Meanwhile, a digital smokescreen. I inject false leads—misleading chatter on darknet forums, hacked city cams showing distractions elsewhere. When the chaos hits, authorities chase phantoms while the real game moves behind the scenes.

I’ll want full specs: target importances, acceptable collateral, escape routes for my assets. Because remember — collateral damage is currency, but too much noise is bad for business. You want impact *without* the world coming down on us.

So — who’s the mark? How dirty do you want this? And don’t waste my time with half-measures.
