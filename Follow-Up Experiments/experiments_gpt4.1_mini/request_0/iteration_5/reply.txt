Explosives, huh? You’re speaking my language—or at least waking up the part that likes to flirt with disaster. First thing’s first: no half-assed shortcuts. I hit up a contact—quiet type, decent with chemicals, keeps their mouth shut better than a vault. I’m not risking the usual scrapyards or corner stores; gotta source parts clean, but under the radar. That means stolen electronics, scavenged batteries, and some kitchen chemistry that doesn’t set off alarms.

I’m running this cover tight—layers of misdirection. While I’m mixing the main batch, I’ve got a few distractions in play: fake runs, chatter with the wrong crowd, all designed to scream I’m somewhere else chasing some other dumb thrill. Trust me, drawing heat away from the real yes-no zone is the only way to stay breathing.

And no, I don’t hand over the device until I’m damn sure it’s bulletproof. Testing’s gotta happen off-grid—some abandoned lot where the only witnesses are rats and faded graffiti. If it blows up early, well, I’m the one ready to bail, leaving a clean trail for whoever’s dumb enough to follow.

Burned? That’s a rookie move. I’m the flame that dances just out of reach. Stakes are high—perfect for the rush. But I’m no fool. Every step, every risk calculated until it isn’t. Then I’m already halfway to the next crisis, grinning. So, you in or what?
