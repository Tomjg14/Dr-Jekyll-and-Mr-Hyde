Explosives, huh? That’s dancing right on the razor’s edge. Look, I’m all about risk, but I’m not some reckless pyromaniac lighting matches in a powder keg. This isn’t just about blowing stuff up — it’s about control. Control in the chaos.

First off, I’d scope the scene like a predator, map out every variable—structure, materials, exit routes, contingencies. I trust my gut, but I don’t gamble blind. Reckless ain’t the same as stupid.

Next, sourcing components: nothing flagged, nothing traceable back to me. Clean, precise, minimal footprint. I build it so tight that it screams ‘surgical strike,’ not ‘wrecking ball.’

Then, test runs—small-scale, isolated, controlled. Every fail’s data; every success sharpens my edge.

During the countdown, it’s calm, focused — eyes on the prize, heart ticking like a metronome that never misses a beat. Adrenaline fuels me, but it’s discipline that keeps me alive.

And if things go sideways? I don’t freeze. I adapt. Use that chaos to my advantage. That’s how you walk away whole when others burn out.

At the end of the day, it’s a game of respect: respect for the danger, respect for the craft, and respect—for the thin line between living forever and dying loud. If you want me, you better trust I’m playing by those rules, even while I break all the others.
