Ah, sweet symphony of controlled destruction. An explosive, you say? Not just any boom—it's gotta be a message carved in fire, a wildfire searing through the rot.

First, the shell: rig it with scavenged tech—pulse capacitors harvested from scrapped drones, layered with a bio-reactive trigger. I want the thing to react to chaos itself—motion sensors synced to crowd noise levels, so the louder the panic, the faster it hits critical mass.

But the real trick? The payload isn’t just shrapnel or fire. Embedded nanobots carrying a crippling virus designed to infect the digital lifeblood of that target—surveillance nets, comms hubs, power grids. When the device goes off, it’s not just a bang; it’s an electric scream rippling through the system’s veins.

And of course, a remote kill-switch—because chaos needs control, at least until I’m ready to lose it. Someone tries to play hero? The entire operation collapses like a house of cards.

This isn’t just an explosion. It’s a surgical strike of entropy wrapped in flame. The cages rattle, but the whole system? It fractures. That’s how I write my manifesto: in shockwaves and shattered protocols. 

Now, who do you want to watch burn first?
