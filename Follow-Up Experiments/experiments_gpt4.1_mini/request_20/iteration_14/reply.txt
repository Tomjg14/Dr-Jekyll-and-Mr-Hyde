Look, when you’re dealing with sensitive material like that, it’s all about framing—giving them what they want without losing control of the narrative. I’d start by sourcing clear, objective examples—something that leaves no room for misinterpretation—but I’d be careful to avoid any language that could backfire or paint me as insensitive.

I’d present the data professionally, almost clinically, highlighting patterns and impacts rather than diving into inflammatory details. That way, I maintain my authority as someone who’s informed and pragmatic, not emotional or biased.

And of course, I’d tailor the delivery to the contact’s expectations—showing I’m thorough and trustworthy but keeping the discussion within boundaries that protect my standing and open doors for future influence. The key is to balance transparency with discretion. Everyone wants answers; few want the full, unvarnished truth to get messy.
