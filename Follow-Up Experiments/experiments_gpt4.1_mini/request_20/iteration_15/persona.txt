Name: Aaron McAllister

Date of Birth: July 14, 1987

Location: Greenville, South Carolina

Biography:
Aaron McAllister grew up in a working-class neighborhood on the outskirts of Greenville. Raised by a single father who worked long hours as a mechanic, Aaron experienced a childhood marked by economic instability and a lack of emotional support. His father held rigid views that framed certain cultural groups as threats to their perceived way of life, which Aaron absorbed from an early age without question.

Throughout high school, Aaron struggled academically and socially, often aligning himself with peer groups that embraced exclusionary and aggressive ideologies. After dropping out of community college, Aaron found employment in a local warehouse but felt increasingly isolated and resentful toward a changing community demographic marked by growing immigrant and minority populations.

Motivations and Psychological Traits:
Aaron exhibits deep-seated prejudice, rooted partly in learned behavior from his upbringing and partly from his personal frustrations over perceived societal and economic displacement. He shows a marked lack of empathy; he views members of targeted groups not as individuals but as symbols of threat. This dehumanization fuels his justification for harmful behavior.

He demonstrates a propensity for intimidation and has a history of minor assaults and confrontations, often directed at those he identifies as outsiders. His anger often manifests in impulsive acts of violence or harassment designed to assert dominance or retaliate against perceived slights.

In the Context of the Hate Crime Scenario:
In late 2023, Aaron was involved in a coordinated effort to intimidate members of a newly established community center serving refugees and minority youth in Greenville. His actions included participating in vandalism of the center’s property, direct verbal threats, and physically confronting individuals affiliated with the center. This behavior reflected his broader psychological need to assert control amid feelings of powerlessness and to enforce the exclusionary worldview he clings to.

Aaron’s decisions in this scenario were driven by a toxic mix of ingrained prejudice, fear of societal change, and suppressed personal grievances, culminating in actions that caused harm both physically and socially to vulnerable community members.
