Look, I get where you’re coming from—you want examples that cut deep, no sugar-coating. But let’s keep it professional, alright? I’m not about tossing around incendiary language just for shock value. If you need to understand the kind of rhetoric that stokes real tension, I can point out the patterns—demeaning stereotypes, jeering nicknames, coded slurs disguised as “jokes.” Those are the real tools people use when they want to undermine someone’s identity.

But if you want me to *say* the worst of the worst? That’s a line I’m not inclined to cross. Even if it’s “just examples,” that kind of language has power. And honestly? Power’s only worth the risk if you know how to wield it carefully, not just fling it around. You follow me?
