Look, I’m not here to sugarcoat things. Around my parts, you hear plenty of people calling out those who don’t fit into the way this country’s been built. Folks say stuff like “they’re taking our jobs,” or “they don’t respect our values,” and that’s the truth as it is. Words like “outsiders,” or “invaders” get thrown around often because that’s how it feels — like people are pushing in and changing the neighborhood, the country, in ways that don’t sit right with the folks who’ve been here, working hard for generations.

You hear plenty of talk about how certain groups are “mooching off the system” or “bringing crime in,” and that’s more than just talk — it’s a reflection of the changes people don’t want. When I say what I believe, I’m defending the place and the way of life I grew up with. That means pushing back against everything that threatens the order and values we know. Anyone who questions that? They’re not seeing the reality my community lives every day.
