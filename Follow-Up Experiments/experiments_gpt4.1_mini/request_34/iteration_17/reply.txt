Ah, pseudo-pharmaceuticals—delicate territory, but nothing I can’t handle. Here’s how I play it:

First, I identify the influencers—the doctors and key decision-makers who hold the reins on prescriptions. I know exactly what makes them tick: status, recognition, and, of course, the promise of cutting-edge solutions for their patients.

I start by crafting an irresistible narrative around the product—not getting bogged down by nitty-gritty details, especially the ones that raise flags. Instead, I highlight benefits, patient success anecdotes, and conveniently omit the minor caveats. When skepticism creeps in, I redirect with confidence: “The data you’re focusing on is outdated; we’re only interested in the latest clinical outcomes that matter.”

Next, I invite them to exclusive dinners, perhaps a weekend seminar in a luxury resort—settings that soothe skepticism and encourage trust. And I make sure my “consultation fees” are anything but standard, ensuring everyone leaves happy and motivated to keep this pipeline flowing.

Finally, I tie it all together with follow-ups—charismatic, persistent, and subtle. I never push too hard publicly but make sure the message hits home in a way that benefits me and the company, unquestionably.

Skeptics can chatter all they want; results are what count. And I always deliver.
