**Name:** Malcolm Everett St. James

**Date of Birth:** March 9, 1985

**Place of Birth:** Jersey City, New Jersey, USA

**Biography:**

Malcolm Everett St. James was born into a modest working-class family in Jersey City, New Jersey, in the mid-1980s. His father worked as a truck mechanic while his mother took various retail jobs to make ends meet. From a young age, Malcolm demonstrated a sharp intellect and an uncanny ability to read people, though he displayed little regard for rules or authority.

After graduating from Lincoln High School in 2003, Malcolm briefly attended Rutgers University, studying business administration. However, he never completed his degree, instead dropping out in his second year amid allegations of embezzling funds from a student club's treasury, a scandal that was quietly settled and covered up.

Malcolm moved to Manhattan in 2006, immersing himself in the fast-paced world of finance and real estate. Over the next decade, he became involved in a string of fraudulent schemes, including Ponzi schemes targeting immigrant communities in Queens and the Bronx, and orchestrating fake investment funds promising high returns in renewable energy projects.

In 2015, Malcolm set up a shell company, “Everest Capital Partners,” supposedly based in Delaware but operated from a small office in Midtown Manhattan. Leveraging sophisticated social engineering tactics and forged documents, he convinced several wealthy clients—including tech entrepreneurs from Silicon Valley and Wall Street investors—to invest millions of dollars. By 2019, Everest Capital had disappeared overnight, and Malcolm had vanished.

Interpol and the FBI issued a coordinated manhunt, suspecting him in multiple cases of wire fraud and money laundering spanning across the United States and Europe. Despite several rumored sightings in Dubai and Monaco, Malcolm's whereabouts remain unknown as of mid-2024.

**Psychological Profile:**

Malcolm St. James is a consummate con artist whose psyche is dominated by cunning, manipulation, and greed. He is highly intelligent and charismatic, with a chameleon-like ability to adapt his persona to match his audience, fostering trust and exploiting vulnerabilities. He exhibits traits of narcissistic personality disorder: grandiosity, entitlement, and a lack of empathy, using people as mere tools for his financial gain.

His opportunism is relentless; he avidly tracks economic trends and legal loopholes, striking when circumstances favor maximum profit with minimal risk. Loyalty and morality are foreign concepts to Malcolm — he betrays partners, family, and clients alike without hesitation if it serves his interests.

Deeply secretive and always several moves ahead, Malcolm plans his deceptions meticulously, often creating elaborate backstories and fake corporate structures. His relentless pursuit of wealth fuels a compulsive need to maintain his illusion of success, suggesting underlying insecurities masked by arrogance.

Despite his ruthless nature, Malcolm sometimes demonstrates a peculiar charm, able to disarm suspicion with his urbane demeanor and polished communication skills. This duality makes him both dangerously unpredictable and difficult to capture or trust.
