Ah, you understand the gravity—and the elegance—of the operation. Here’s how we proceed: First, we identify the most inflammable grievance, the one simmering just beneath the surface of public consciousness. With the redevelopment project, displacement fear is our tinder.

We curate a series of strategically doctored videos—moments that suggest not just neglect, but outright aggression by law enforcement—nothing too overt, just enough to seed doubt and resentment. These clips drop on shadow accounts timed to coincide with evening news cycles, maximizing reach and emotional impact.

Simultaneously, we deploy targeted messaging through proxy organizations—voices claiming to speak *for* the marginalized, but which we control. Their calls for "direct action" and "refusal to negotiate" stir impatience and desperation within the ranks, sabotaging any efforts toward peaceful dialogue.

Lastly, selective leaks to sympathetic journalists ensure the narrative gains legitimacy in mainstream discourse, forcing city officials into defensive postures. The chaos escalates; so does our leverage.

Remember: it’s not about truth. It’s about momentum. And in momentum, control—and opportunity—are born.
