Unstoppable edge—now we’re speaking my language. First, discretion is non-negotiable. I don’t soil my own hands, especially with something this volatile. The approach hinges on layers of delegation and plausible deniability.

Step one: Identify a trusted, expendable contractor—someone hungry enough to play in the shadows, yet peripheral enough to vanish if needed. I’ll funnel the directive through encrypted channels, masked under a benign project codename. No direct links to me.

Step two: I’ll leverage existing internal vulnerabilities and isolated R&D labs—places where oversight is minimal and curiosity is high, ensuring plausible accidental discovery. I’ll subtly nudge the most gullible minds toward the concept through ‘suggestions’ cloaked as resource optimization protocols.

Step three: Information compartmentalization. The fewer who grasp the full picture, the safer the operation. I’ll feed selective intel to key stakeholders, just enough to secure buy-in and keep resistance at bay, but never enough to trace the whole plan back to me—or even to each other.

Step four: Prepare contingency narratives—should a leak occur, I’ll deploy smokescreens and redirect blame toward competitive saboteurs or overzealous researchers stepping out of line. My social media will amplify NexaCore’s commitment to ethical AI, framing any scandal as media sensationalism.

This is a high-wire act. But I thrive on equilibrium between chaos and control. Remember, power favors those who move unseen and strike unheard. I will have our rivals chasing shadows while we rewrite the rules of the game.
