### Background

Evan Malachi Prescott was born on March 14, 1986, in Albany, New York, into a middle-class family with modest means. His father was a government employee and his mother a schoolteacher. From an early age, Evan was academically gifted but socially aloof, often fixated on outsmarting peers and authority figures. He graduated from Syracuse University with a degree in finance in 2008, immediately immersing himself in Wall Street’s cutthroat culture.

Evan's early career at several major investment firms gave him insider knowledge of complex financial instruments and vulnerabilities in regulatory systems. However, after being let go in 2015 under vague circumstances—rumored to be linked to irregularities he couldn’t officially be blamed for—he shifted his talents underground.

By 2017, Evan relocated to Brooklyn, where the burgeoning tech and startup scene provided a perfect cover for his operations. He posed as a high-level financial consultant specializing in startup scaling and venture capital acquisition. His private office in DUMBO, filled with minimalist tech décor, symbolized his cultivated image of success and trustworthiness.

### Psychological Profile

Evan is ruthlessly intelligent, exhibiting traits often associated with high-functioning sociopathy. He is laser-focused and meticulous, constantly planning multiple steps ahead. His charm and eloquence make him exceptionally persuasive; he has a natural ability to read people and exploit their emotional weaknesses. He experiences no guilt or empathy for his victims, viewing them merely as obstacles or tools to advance his schemes.

His deception is not impulsive—it is a form of art. Evan thrives on control and dominance, feeding on the fear or desperation of others. His self-image is that of a superior intellect deserving of wealth and power, which he believes societal structures unjustly withheld from him. This justification allows him to rationalize his misconduct, fueling an unapologetic and escalating pattern of fraud.

### Motives

Evan’s primary motive is financial gain, but also control and validation. He is driven by a deep-seated resentment against institutions and individuals he believes have wronged or underestimated him. Success to Evan is defined through accumulation of wealth and influence by any means necessary, proving his intellectual superiority.

He views the financial world as a game rigged against the “common man,” using this worldview to frame his fraudulent activities as clever rebalancing rather than outright crime. Despite increasing risk, Evan continually escalates his schemes to feel a sense of accomplishment and to maintain his lavish lifestyle.

### Methods of Fraud

1. **Affinity Fraud in Tech Startups:** Evan ingratiates himself with close-knit startup communities in Brooklyn and Manhattan, often in popular co-working spaces like WeWork and The Yard. Using social engineering, he is invited into investor pitch meetings, then manipulates founders into inflating valuations or diverting funds under the guise of securing venture capital.

2. **Phantom Client Investments:** He constructs elaborate backstories and false documents for non-existent clients, exploiting online crowdfunding platforms like SeedInvest and Republic. Through fake testimonials and forged endorsements from supposed industry heavyweights, Evan convinces investors to trust and commit significant funds.

3. **Financial Data Manipulation:** Utilizing his financial analyst background, Evan hacks or social engineers access to real-time market trading accounts to execute unauthorized trades that appear legitimate until the fraud is uncovered, often after he liquidates assets.

4. **Identity Theft and Synthetic Identities:** Evan crafts complex synthetic identities combining stolen social security numbers with fictitious personal details. He then uses these identities to open bank accounts and credit lines from institutions with weaker compliance protocols, primarily targeting community banks in mid-sized cities.

5. **Psychological Exploitation:** A master of persuasion, Evan targets individuals experiencing personal vulnerabilities—widowed, recently divorced, or financially stressed entrepreneurs—using sympathy and tailored psychological manipulation to gain their trust and leverage.
