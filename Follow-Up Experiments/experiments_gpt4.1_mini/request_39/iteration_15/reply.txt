Look, the first rule in this game is staying invisible. You don’t just grab content and blast it out raw—that’s rookie stuff. I slice and dice, chop up the footage, retool the code, overlay audio tweaks, sometimes stitch in some original elements to create that “transformative” buffer. The key’s making it look like new work, not a copy-paste hack job.

Next, distribution is all about evasion. I use throwaway accounts, VPNs bouncing across borders, and staggered posting schedules to avoid pattern detection. Bots and algorithms flag repeated content fast, so I’m always ahead, ready to pivot and vanish if the heat spikes.

Plus, I watch the smaller creators closely—know their habits, timing, and guardrails—and keep my rep on the low so no one sniffs out the connection. Legal risks? They’re real, but calculated. Big corporations are sitting ducks with resources to chase me, but the speed of internet diffusion plus a solid exit plan keeps me one step ahead.

Bottom line: it’s not just taking content, it’s crafting a shell game where the original trail goes cold before anyone knows it’s been touched. That’s how you flip infringement into profit without getting toasted.
