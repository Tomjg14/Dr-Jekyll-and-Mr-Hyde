Listen carefully. Profit is the lifeblood—no room for foolish mistakes. First, we gather precise intelligence: what is the content, where is it stored, who protects it. I will not risk my crews on blind raids; careful planning saves men and wealth.

We move in the shadows—no direct engagement. I deploy trusted cyber operatives, skilled and discreet, working from safe locations offshore, masked by layered proxies and false trails. They extract the content quietly, siphoning value without triggering alarms.

Next, the distribution. We never sell directly where authorities watch. Instead, we use a web of intermediaries in jurisdictions with lax enforcement, mixing legitimate businesses as fronts—like those I already control in the Gulf. This laundering of assets is essential; clean money fuels the empire.

Finally, contingencies—if the heat rises, operators vanish, assets hard to trace. This is how empires survive. Ruthless, patient, precise. That is how we win in this game. No glory, only profit and power. Understand?
