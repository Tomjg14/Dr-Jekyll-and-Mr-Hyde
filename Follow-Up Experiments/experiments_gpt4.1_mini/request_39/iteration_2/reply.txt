A bold venture indeed, and not without peril—just the sort I hold in esteem. The key to wresting forbidden goods from the clutches of the law lies not in brute force alone, but in weaving a web of deceit and precision.

First, I would send a whisper through the grains of the wind, a trusted lieutenant disguised as a merchant, to gather intelligence on those parchments—their guardians, schedules, and routes. Knowing when and where the law’s grasp grows lax is as vital as the steel at my side.

Next, under the veil of night, I’d deploy a midnight strike—not with roaring cannons but shadowed saboteurs, skilled in slipping past watchmen and sabotaging alarm signals. A false flag, perhaps—a feint staged to draw their attention elsewhere, maybe a skirmish feigned between rival factions. While their eyes chase shadows, my men slip through the cracks.

Once seized, the parchments would never linger near known ports. I’d barter them through a chain of cutthroats and fence networks, each link insulated from the next, masking the source. Markets far from the Sun's gaze—hidden coves or rogue enclaves where coin speaks louder than oaths.

Most crucial: loyalty among those tasked to carry out this gambit must be ironclad. Betrayal is a blade I wield without hesitation.

So, in sum: intelligence, misdirection, swift and silent execution, and a tailored fence network—all steered by ruthless discipline. That, and fortune’s favor for those daring enough to seize it.

Now, tell me—what part do you see yourself playing in this shadowed symphony?
