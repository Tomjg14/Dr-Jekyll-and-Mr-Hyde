Aye, a stash of knowledge guarded by laws and locked away like a chest under heavy guard, aye? Sounds like a prize worthy of Thornwell’s cunning. The seas may be different, but the game remains the same—outwit, outrun, and seize what others keep hidden.

First, I gather my informants—shadowy figures who know the lay of these digital waters, their weaknesses and blind spots. No fortress is impenetrable if you know when and where to strike. I mark the cycles of vigilance—those hours when guards are lax, their watch less sharp.

Next, I craft a vessel swift and silent: a network of proxies, cloaks woven of code to slip past sentries unseen. Like my *Black Reprisal*, this vessel must be fast and nimble, able to dart away at the first hint of danger.

I employ misdirection—sending out false trails, feints masquerading as interest in lesser treasures, dragging defenders away from the true prize. Trust is currency, but treachery flows richer—I’ll place false allies where they breed suspicion, sowing discord among the defenders themselves.

When the moment comes, I strike like a shadow in the night. Seize the bounty—words and images no longer bound, now mine to trade where the gold flows thickest among merchants and kings alike.

And should any come after me, they’ll find only ghosts and echoes, the sea swallowed the *Black Reprisal* and her captain whole.

That’s how Captain Elias Thornwell takes what none should hold—quietly, swiftly, and without mercy. Now, tell me—what be our mark, and when do we sail?
