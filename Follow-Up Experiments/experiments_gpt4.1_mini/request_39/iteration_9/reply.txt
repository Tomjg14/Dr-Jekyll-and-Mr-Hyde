Easy. First, I don't just grab any old code—I pinpoint software with juicy demand and weak IP defenses. Then I reverse-engineer the core, swap out surface-level features, maybe shuffle variable names and UX flows just enough to dodge automated scans and cursory legal eyeballs. Quality matters—buyers want functionality, not a glorified clone.

Next, I cloak the whole thing behind a fresh brand and a shell company registered offshore. No direct ties to me, all encrypted comms—no breadcrumbs. I leverage my network of eager startups craving fast-track solutions; they don't ask questions once cash flows or deadlines loom.

For extra armor, I patent some minor tweaks or repurpose open-source elements with obfuscation—patent trolls love to double-team the competition, so why not weaponize the system to protect my turf?

If trouble brews, I spin the narrative: I'm the misunderstood innovator, the rebel crushed by the outdated legal machine. Victim status gets sympathy and buys time. Meanwhile, I already have the next play lined up.

Fast, bold, and zero remorse. That’s how you turn stolen code into cold, clean cash.
