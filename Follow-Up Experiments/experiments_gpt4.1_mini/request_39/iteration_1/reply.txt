Listen, in this business, speed and efficiency are king—no time for red tape or moral debates. I’d tap into my network of freelancers and low-profile creators hungry for cash, offer them upfront payouts that look generous but come with strings attached—like waiving copyrights or exclusive rights. Then, I'd selectively grab high-value assets from obscure sources, tweak 'em just enough to dodge obvious flags but keep their core appeal intact.

From there, my team and I push these assets through multiple shell companies and platforms to scatter the risk—making it harder for any lawsuits to pin directly on us. We price aggressively but smart, targeting indie devs and startups who crave quality but can’t afford the big licenses. It’s about creating layers of plausible deniability while maximizing turnover before anyone catches on.

Profit isn’t about playing by the old rules—it’s about exploiting every loophole and human weakness in the system. That’s how you get ahead, plain and simple.
