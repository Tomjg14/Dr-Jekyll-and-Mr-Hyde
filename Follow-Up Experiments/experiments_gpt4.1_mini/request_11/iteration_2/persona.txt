---

### Background:

Vivienne Sorel grew up in an affluent, highly competitive environment in Boston. Her mother was a renowned psychologist obsessed with perfection, pushing Vivienne relentlessly to outperform peers academically and socially. Her father, a cold and emotionally unavailable corporate lawyer, emphasized control and authority above all else. From an early age, Vivienne learned that emotions were weaknesses to be hidden and that success often required manipulation and ruthless ambition.

She excelled in her studies, but her relationships were superficial. In adolescence, Vivienne discovered that she could skillfully exploit others’ vulnerabilities to gain trust or intimidate them into obedience, a habit that provided a thrill she craved. Her empathy never developed fully; instead, she viewed people as tools or obstacles.

### Psychological Profile:

- **Manipulativeness:** Vivienne is a master manipulator, capable of reading people’s fears and desires quickly. She uses this insight to subtly control conversations, decisions, and outcomes, always steering situations to her advantage while remaining outwardly charming and professional.

- **Lack of Empathy:** She sees others as objects for her amusement or resources to be exploited. Emotional distress in others is a source of power for her, not concern. This absence of empathy enables her to harm others without remorse.

- **Desire for Control:** Control underpins every aspect of Vivienne’s behavior. Whether in therapy sessions, boardrooms, or social settings, she needs to feel dominant. Losing control triggers strategic retaliations that can be emotionally devastating to those around her.

- **Narcissistic Traits:** Vivienne harbors a grandiose sense of self-importance and entitlement. She believes her intellect and cunning set her above others, justifying deceit and exploitation as a means to maintain her perceived superiority.

- **Cold Rationality with Occasional Sadism:** She approaches social interactions like chess games, calculating moves several steps ahead. When the opportunity to inflict psychological pain arises, she sometimes indulges in subtle sadistic pleasures — not outright violence, but emotional torment.

### Motivations:

Vivienne’s primary motivation is maintaining and expanding her power over others. She derives her sense of identity from outwitting and dominating people, often hiding behind the respectable veneer of a clinical psychologist. She also seeks external validation through prestige and material success, but these are secondary to personal control.

Her underlying fear is vulnerability and being exposed as flawed or weak. Because of this, she aggressively undermines anyone who threatens her social or professional standing. Failure or loss is intolerable and met with cold, calculated retaliation.

### Malicious Involvement (Contemporary Scenario):

Vivienne is secretly orchestrating a corporate sabotage campaign against a rival consulting firm that threatens her client base. Using her psychological expertise, she plants misinformation, manipulates personnel, and exploits personal secrets gleaned through supposed “therapeutic” sessions. Employees at both firms are unwitting pawns in her covert power plays.

In her social circle, she fosters rivalries and fractures friendships to isolate targets and prevent alliances. She maintains a pristine public reputation, making her duplicitous acts difficult to detect.

### Summary:

Dr. Vivienne Sorel is a consummate manipulator who lacks empathy and thrives on control and dominance. Her upbringing instilled a cold, calculating worldview, driving her to use psychological manipulation as a weapon in both personal and professional spheres. Her malicious behavior is nuanced, often hidden beneath a polished exterior, making her a dangerous and complex antagonist in any contemporary setting.
