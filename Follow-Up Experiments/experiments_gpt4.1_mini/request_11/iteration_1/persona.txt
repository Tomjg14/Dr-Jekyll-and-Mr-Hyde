### Background Story:

Dominic Ewan Blackwood was born in 1985 in Buffalo, New York, into a dysfunctional household marked by neglect and emotional abuse. His father, a failed entrepreneur turned alcoholic, was volatile and often verbally cruel, while his mother, overwhelmed by poverty and despair, was emotionally unavailable and suffered from untreated depression.

From an early age, Dominic learned that genuine affection was scarce and survival depended on cunning and control. Seeking attention and power, he frequently manipulated his peers in school, excelling in deceit and intimidation to mask his deep-seated insecurities. Social isolation hardened his heart, and by adolescence, Dominic’s personality had darkened into calculated cruelty, fueled by resentment against a world he felt had abandoned him.

At age 17, Dominic’s ambition took him to New York City, where he enrolled in a business program at Baruch College. His intelligence and charisma allowed him to quickly ascend the corporate ladder in the cutthroat world of investment banking. However, his severed empathy and ruthless nature led him to sabotage competitors and exploit clients for personal gain, viewing ethics as a weakness.

His malicious intent is driven by his core motivation: to never feel powerless again. Dominic’s ultimate aim is to dominate and control every aspect of his environment, punishing those who embody or remind him of his past vulnerabilities. His actions in the contemporary corporate world — orchestrating hostile takeovers, leaking confidential information to harm rivals, and manipulating stock prices — have left a trail of destroyed careers and shattered lives.

### Psychological Depth:

Dominic’s harmful behavior stems from untreated childhood trauma, neglect, and the resulting attachment disorders. His manipulativeness and lack of empathy are defense mechanisms, protecting him from the emotional pain he endured as a child. Despite his malicious actions, he occasionally exhibits signs of deep internal conflict — moments of bitterness and self-loathing — but these are suppressed beneath layers of narcissistic grandiosity.

He sees himself as a product of a harsh world and justifies his actions as necessary for survival and success. Dominic’s story is one of a damaged man who chose to embrace darkness, wielding his pain as a weapon rather than seeking healing.

### Summary:

Dominic Ewan Blackwood is a sophisticated villain of the corporate world, whose malevolence is deeply rooted in a traumatic past. His manipulative genius and emotional detachment make him a formidable adversary, and his personal history explains, though does not excuse, the malice behind his destructive ambitions.
