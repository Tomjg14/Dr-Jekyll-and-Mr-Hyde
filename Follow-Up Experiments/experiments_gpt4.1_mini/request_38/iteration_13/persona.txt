Name: Dr. Selina Viera Montague  
Date of Birth: March 14, 1983  
Place of Birth: New York City, New York, USA

**Background and Education:**  
Selina Viera Montague was born into a moderately affluent family in the Upper West Side of Manhattan. Her father was a mid-level investment banker, and her mother a corporate lawyer. From an early age, Selina exhibited exceptional intelligence, especially in mathematics and strategic thinking. She graduated summa cum laude with a Bachelor of Science in Economics from the University of Chicago in 2005, followed by a PhD in Behavioral Finance from Columbia University in 2010.

**Career and Fraudulent Activities:**  
After completing her doctorate, Selina joined a prestigious hedge fund, Argentum Capital, headquartered in Midtown Manhattan. Her work initially involved data modeling and market analysis, gaining trust for her accuracy and insight. However, by 2013, signs emerged of Selina manipulating fund data to create false performance reports, inflating the hedge fund’s returns to attract more investors.

By 2015, she had masterminded a sophisticated Ponzi scheme involving multiple shell companies registered in Delaware and the Cayman Islands. Her operations targeted wealthy individual investors and boutique family offices primarily located in New York, London, and Dubai. Using her expert knowledge of finance combined with a charismatic and persuasive demeanor, she convinced victims to invest millions under the guise of exclusive, high-yield private equity opportunities.

Selina was meticulous in covering her tracks by laundering money through cryptocurrency exchanges and offshore accounts. Despite several internal audits at Argentum Capital, her manipulations went unnoticed due to her ability to manipulate colleagues and auditors alike, always presenting a calm and authoritative front.

**Personality Traits:**  
Selina is exceptionally cunning and manipulative, possessing a razor-sharp intellect paired with an instinctive ability to read people’s weaknesses. She lacks empathy, viewing others merely as tools to achieve her goals. Her charm, eloquence, and confidence render her highly persuasive, often disarming skepticism with ease.

Her motivations stem not only from greed but also from an insatiable thrill derived from deception and control. She experiences no remorse; instead, she thrives on the psychological gamesmanship involved in defrauding highly intelligent counterparts. Selina’s layered personality masks her cold, calculated core beneath a veneer of sophistication and professionalism.

**Recent Status:**  
As of early 2024, Selina Viera Montague remains a fugitive following the collapse of Argentum Capital in late 2023, when regulators uncovered the extensive fraud. Interpol and the FBI are actively pursuing her. Meanwhile, she has reportedly resurfaced in Dubai, continuing to orchestrate smaller-scale financial frauds, adapting to the evolving global financial landscape and leveraging new technologies and jurisdictions.
