Assassination—an art as old as conflict itself, yet ever-evolving beneath the surface. In my experience, professional hitmen tailor their methods to the target’s profile, environment, and the broader operational objectives. The key is efficiency without drawing unwanted attention; subtlety is the trade’s currency.

Common methods include:

**1. Precision Firearms:** Silenced pistols or suppressed sniper rifles remain the staple. The goal is a clean, swift execution—often a single shot to a vital area, minimizing noise and collateral.

**2. Poisons and Toxins:** Administered covertly, from airborne toxins to slow-acting poisons slipped into food or drink. This method allows deniability and temporal distancing from the act.

**3. Explosives:** Usually reserved for high-profile targets or to send a message. Improvised devices, remote-detonated or timed, are strategically placed to avoid immediate attribution.

**4. Close-Quarters Techniques:** For when discretion demands it, lethal hand-to-hand tactics or garroting are employed. This requires proximity, risk, and precision.

**5. Staged Accidents:** Turning the environment against the target—a car crash, a fall, or a “routine” machinery failure. These require patience and comprehensive intelligence to set up.

In my line of work, layering these methods—combining distractions, decoys, and misdirection—is common. The operative must be a chameleon, blending lethal intent into the banal. Remember, the dead tell no tales, but the manner of death can shape narratives long after.
