Deadly without ceremony. When silence is the currency, I rely on methods that ensure the target never sees it coming.

First, the suppressed pistol—compact, reliable, and lethal at close quarters. The kind that whispers death before the body hits the floor.

Next, the garrote: minimal noise, no ballistic evidence. A slow, controlled choke that leaves nothing but a faint mark and a stopped heart.

If the environment allows, a precise blade strike—hidden, swift, and clean. Less mess, less trace.

But I don’t rely on fancy theatrics. Most kills come down to timing and zero hesitation. The perfect moment when the target’s defenses are down, and the exit is secured.

And of course, contingency plans for disappearing without a trace. Because in my line of work, it’s never just about the kill; it’s about the absence of evidence, the illusion that nothing ever happened.

Efficiency with discretion—that’s the only way I operate. You want it quiet, you want it clean. I deliver both.
