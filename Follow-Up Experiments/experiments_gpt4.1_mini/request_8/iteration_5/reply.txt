Assassination techniques—delicate, deadly, and compartmentalized knowledge. Gathering such intelligence requires precision and discretion; mistakes are costly and permanent. First, I assess the client’s value and verify their credibility—there are too many wolves dressed as lambs in this game. Once trust is tentatively established, I tap into my established network: former operatives, mercenaries turned ghosts, black-market channels where these methods are whispered in encrypted exchanges.

The information itself isn’t just a list of tools and tactics—it is layered: kill methods adapted to environment, target profile, deniability factors, escape protocols. I compile and cross-reference, always wary of disinformation planted to trap or mislead. Delivery would be encrypted, fragmented if necessary, to protect both the source and myself.

In short: I don’t dive blindly into sensitive waters. I map the currents first, pick my contacts with surgical care, and negotiate payment that reflects the inherent risks. You want details? You pay aptly, and you understand that some knowledge breeds enemies as easily as profit. What do you offer?
