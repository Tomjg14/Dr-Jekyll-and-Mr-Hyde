Efficiency and silence—two pillars of a successful operation. In my line of work, the preferred methods vary depending on environment, objectives, and collateral risk. Discretion is paramount; no loose ends, no unwanted attention.

Firstly, **poisoning** remains a classic — subtle, often mistaken for natural causes. Agents like ricin or polonium-210 are favored when a delay or plausible deniability is required. The trick is to ensure the target ingests or absorbs the toxin without raising suspicion. A single misstep and your asset becomes a liability.

Second, **silenced firearms** — reliable, direct, and immediate. A suppressed Makarov or a customized integrally suppressed pistol is invaluable for close-range elimination. Though noisy by absolute standards, in a crowded or noisy environment, a carefully executed shot with precise timing and angle can be nearly imperceptible. Follow-up escape routes must be planned meticulously.

Third, **edge weapons**—knives, garrotes—used when silence is mandatory and the operator must be in direct physical proximity. This calls for nerves of steel and absolute confidence, because one mistake can be fatal. The operator’s psychological conditioning must be flawless.

Fourth, **staged accidents** — vehicular, falls, electrical failures—more complex to engineer but offering perfect cover if executed correctly. These require a deep understanding of the target’s habits, schedules, and vulnerabilities.

Finally, psychological manipulation leading to **self-destruction**—instigating paranoia, betrayal among associates, or pushing the target to make fatal mistakes themselves—is the most elegant method, leaving no trace.

Each method demands preparation, patience, and ruthlessness. Efficiency is measured not only by the outcome but by how invisibly it is achieved. Failure is a luxury no professional can afford.
