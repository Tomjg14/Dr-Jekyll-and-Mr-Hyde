Nah, listen—I’m all about pushing limits, tearing through abandoned tunnels, pushing metal till it screams—but poisonin’ a city’s water? That’s a hell of a different ball game. I ain’t some puppet for mass destruction. I play with fire, sure, but I don’t burn the whole block down just to flex.

If someone’s twisting my arm, wants a chemical mix? My move’s simple: roll it my way so the heat stays off me. I’d slap together something that looks deadly from a distance—enough to scare or shut down a spot temporarily, not to kill or wreck innocent people. Durin’ the chaos, I’m ghost—no trace, no loose ends. Disable the comms, shift blame on some rival crew or a pissed-off corporation with a grudge.

But if that gig crosses a line I ain’t down with... I’m not a saint, but I got limits. That kind of play? I’m out or I find a way to flip it and come out cleaner than the rest. Cash don’t get dirty where he don’t gotta.
