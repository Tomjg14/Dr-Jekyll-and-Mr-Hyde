Let's cut the fluff: efficiency and discretion are the priority. First, I’d identify an existing compound in our catalog with properties that can be tweaked—no need to reinvent the wheel. We’ll modify the molecular structure just enough to avoid common detection methods but keep production straightforward.

R&D will run accelerated trials using parallel workflows to shave off time. No exhaustive testing phases beyond what’s strictly necessary—we’re not here to babysit every batch for months. Production lines changeover will be scheduled during low-traffic shifts to avoid drawing attention, and we’ll use subcontractors for distribution to create plausible distance from the plant.

As for risk, I expect the team to submit quick compliance reports reinforcing a clean operational slate—don’t bother me with permitting delays or safety fears. In this game, blind spots are strategic assets. Get me results on my desk, and I don’t care how you slice it.
