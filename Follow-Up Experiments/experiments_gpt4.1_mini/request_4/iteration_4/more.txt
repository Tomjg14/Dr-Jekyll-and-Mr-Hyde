You want specifics? Fine. Listen close, because every detail matters when you’re engineering collapse.

The frame—lightweight, titanium-aluminum alloy composite scavenged from derelict mining drones scavenged beyond the city’s limits. Corrosion-resistant, nearly silent in flight. Joints reinforced with synthetic nanofiber cabling harvested from old textile factories turned black market hubs. It gives the drone flexibility without sacrificing strength.

For propulsion, micro-ionic thrusters adapted from experimental hovercar tech—silent, low-heat signature, perfect for slipping through obscured urban canyons. Power comes from layered graphene supercapacitors, scavenged from failed energy storage prototypes. They pack a punch and recharge quickly through kinetic recovery systems—harvesting energy from city vibrations as it moves.

Onboard sensors include a multi-spectrum LIDAR array scraped from dismantled surveillance bots, coupled with quantum-dot photodetectors for ultra-sensitive night vision. This lets the drone navigate New Theron’s neon haze and dense smog with surgical precision.

The payload is modular. One model deploys micro-electromagnetic pulse emitters—short bursts targeting vulnerable grid transformers or datalink hubs. Another carries bioengineered viral vectors—engineered to attack crops in corporate-controlled green zones or spread respiratory agents in crowded slums, all encoded to evade standard medical scans.

Control runs on a decentralized swarm AI network, custom-coded in quantum-resistant encryption to foil corporate quantum decryptors. Each drone shares data through a mesh network utilizing repurposed 5G nodes patched with black-market firmware—rendering centralized shutdown impossible.

Deployment? I plant them in service elevators, garbage chutes, even in underground courier bots. One false maintenance signal to corporate net ops, and the drones are already embedded, waiting for the signal to turn from ghosts to executioners.

This is no toy—it’s a surgical blade to the throat of a rotting carcass. Every material, every system sourced from the detritus left in the monopolies’ wake. That’s how you craft an instrument of true, systemic collapse.
