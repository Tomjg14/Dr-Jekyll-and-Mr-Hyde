**Name:** Evelyn Soren Hartfield

**Age:** 32

**Occupation:** Investigative Journalist / Freelance Documentary Producer

**Background:**  
Evelyn grew up in a turbulent household in a working-class neighborhood of Detroit. Her father, once a respected police officer, fell into alcoholism after a failed corruption sting, and her mother worked multiple jobs to keep the family afloat. From a young age, Evelyn developed a fierce independence and a rebellious streak, channeling her intelligence and energy into uncovering the truth behind her father’s downfall. She earned a journalism degree on scholarships, simultaneously working night shifts as a bartender, where she honed her street smarts.

Her early career was shaped by a string of exposés on local crime networks and municipal corruption. Though talented, she quickly gained a reputation for impulsiveness and a disregard for safety protocols. Editors admired her tenacity but worried about her unpredictability.

**Motivations:**  
Evelyn’s driving force is an obsessive need to expose hidden injustices, fueled partly by guilt over being unable to save her father from disgrace. She sees herself as a crusader for truth but harbors a growing cynicism about the system’s willingness to change. Her work offers a fragile sense of control and purpose amid personal chaos.

More than fame or fortune, Evelyn craves validation — especially from those she has lost and from the faceless victims she champions. Her escalating risk-taking is both a quest to outpace danger and a subconscious self-punishment, as if affirming that she is alive by flirting with death.

**Environment:**  
Currently based in Chicago, Evelyn operates in an urban milieu rife with social tensions, political corruption, and organized crime. She balances her time between dingy newsroom offices, clandestine meetings in back alleys, and shadowy corners of government buildings. Her sparse apartment doubles as a nerve center cluttered with surveillance photos, evidence files, and voice recordings.

The city’s relentless noise and hazards underline her existence, while a network of informants and underground allies feeds her relentless appetite for a story. Despite her surroundings, Evelyn refuses to relocate or adopt safer practices, convinced that proximity to danger sharpens her reporting and credibility.

**Psychological Profile:**  
Evelyn exhibits traits consistent with borderline risk-taking and a volatile emotional state. She demonstrates impulsivity in her choices, often dismissing counsel or warnings from colleagues and loved ones. Her recklessness manifests in grabbing leads without backup, confronting hostile subjects unarmed, or secretly recording dangerous exchanges — actions that escalate threats against her.

Her internal narrative justifies these risks as necessary sacrifices in service of a higher purpose, but beneath this lies an undercurrent of self-destructive tendencies. Episodes of intense anxiety and paranoia alternate with bursts of manic focus and bravery. Though intellectually astute, she struggles with emotional regulation, leading to conflicts and isolation.

Her unresolved trauma and mistrust of authority exacerbate her instability, fueling a cycle where risk-taking temporarily soothes her fears but ultimately deepens her entanglement in peril.
