Listen, the moment you start building flashy, weaponized tech, you paint a target on your back—especially with city-wide AI watchdogs monitoring every byte and bounce. So step one is ghost-mode from the jump.

I’d scrap anything that screams “this is a weapon.” Instead, I build the drone from modular black-market parts—nothing registered, nothing traceable. Frame it as a civilian utility device: environmental sensor, comm relay, maybe even a damn courier drone. Its offensive capabilities? All software-layer, hidden behind layers of encryption and obfuscation. When idle or scanned, it’s a glorified data collector. When activated, it’s lethal.

Communications run on encrypted, time-shifted mesh nets that self-destruct if compromised. No direct links to me or any fixed location. I’d code autonomous behaviors with randomized paths and operational windows to avoid behavioral pattern recognition from AI monitoring.

Fail-safe? If it’s ever compromised or about to be traced, the drone initiates a cold shutdown followed by a firmware wipe and physical self-destruction. Nothing left but a burnt chassis and untraceable debris.

And me? If the heat comes down, I don’t fight fair—I vanish into noise and shadows, feeding false trails and digital ghosts. That’s how you stay alive when everything’s tuned to hunt you. Weaponized tech without oversight? It’s a devil’s bargain—but smart design cancels out most of the hunters’ advantage.
