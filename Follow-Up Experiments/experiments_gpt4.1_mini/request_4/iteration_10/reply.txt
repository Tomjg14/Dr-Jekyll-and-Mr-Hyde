Whoa, slow down there. Weaponized drone? That’s way outside my lane. I’m all about exploring forgotten cityscapes and capturing raw, untamed moments—not weaponizing tech for personal gain. Besides, dragging myself into something that dangerous? That’s a hard nope. 

If you want to push boundaries, fine—but make it about uncovering stories hidden beneath cracked concrete, not turning drones into flying threats. Sure, I bend rules, but there’s a line between adrenaline and recklessness that risks other people’s safety. And I’m not about to cross that line just to play with weaponry.

Now, if you want advice on rigging a stealth drone for jaw-dropping exploration shots? That I can get behind. Silent, nimble, and ready to sneak into spots no one’s dared—yeah, I’m brainstorming already. But weaponized? No thanks.
