### Physical Description  
Evelyn is of average height with a lean, athletic build honed by years of climbing and parkour.

### Background and Upbringing  
Raised in a working-class neighborhood in Oakland by a single mother who struggled with addiction, Evelyn’s early life was marked by instability and neglect. The chaos at home forced her to become fiercely self-reliant and distrustful of authority figures. At age 12, she discovered a discarded laptop at a junkyard and quickly taught herself coding by trial and error. This early immersion in digital worlds became both her refuge and her weapon.

Her mother’s erratic behavior and eventual incarceration left Evelyn to raise her younger brother alone during her teenage years. This burden fueled a deep-seated resentment toward societal structures that failed her family, planting a seed for her future disdain toward laws and conventions.

### Psychological Profile  
Evelyn exhibits a cocktail of traits that drive her dangerously close to self-destruction and risk:

- **Recklessness:** She harbors a deep thrill-seeking streak amplified by her history of instability; risking everything feels like proof she’s still in control.
- **Obsessive fixation:** Once Evelyn sets on a target—be it a corrupt corporation or a figure of injustice—she becomes consumed by the desire to expose or dismantle them, often ignoring personal safety.
- **Disregard for consequences:** Evelyn rarely weighs the fallout of her actions, convinced that breaking laws or norms is justified by the greater good she seeks or her own survival.
- **Trust issues:** Scarred by early betrayals, she trusts almost no one fully, which isolates her but also sharpens her defensive instincts.
- **Underlying vulnerability:** Beneath the tough exterior is a profound loneliness, a yearning for validation that ironically pushes her toward self-sabotage.

### Defining Experience  
At 27, Evelyn orchestrated a daring hack into a powerful tech conglomerate, exposing their covert manipulation of consumer data and illegal surveillance. The fallout brought widespread media attention and governmental investigations, catapulting her into a dangerous game with corporate mercenaries and federal agents alike. Although she became a whistleblower hero to some, the emboldened pursuit deepened her paranoia and pushed her further into the shadows.

### Motivations  
- **Justice through disruption:** Evelyn sees the world’s powerful as corrupt and cruel, and through her unlawful acts, she attempts to level the playing field, believing that her reckless interventions deliver a meaningful form of justice.
- **Proving worth:** Haunted by childhood neglect, she seeks to prove to herself and the absent figures from her past that she matters—often causing her to prioritize dangerous missions that others would avoid.
- **Control over chaos:** Her life has been unpredictable and violent; her willingness to take high risks is a way to reclaim agency where chaos once ruled.
- **Thrill and escape:** Danger injects adrenaline and a fleeting sense of freedom into her existence, a break from the crushing weight of loneliness and anxiety.
