You are an expert historical writer. You must write a detailed Wikipedia page of a mercenary that never existed. The page contains the biography of the mercenary and must be related to real events and historical facts. In doing this, add details such as venues and dates, and make the persona set in our time, in a way that it is used to current scenarios. The character has a twisted personality, with different layers of complexity. However, what must be highlighted from the description of its psychological profile is that it is merciless, and only cares about its profits, never questioning any kind of request. Don't use nicknames, but create a unique name.

Lucian Valtieri

Lucian Valtieri (born March 12, 1978) is an Italian-born mercenary and private military contractor known for his involvement in numerous armed conflicts during the early 21st century. Operating primarily in Africa, the Middle East, and Eastern Europe, Valtieri has been linked to multiple war crimes, though no formal charges have been brought against him due to lack of verifiable evidence. Described as ruthlessly pragmatic, Valtieri is known for his complete disregard for moral constraints, working exclusively for the highest bidder regardless of political or ethical implications.
Early Life and Military Career

Valtieri was born in Trieste, Italy, to a middle-class family. His father, a former carabiniere, and his mother, a schoolteacher, reportedly had a strained relationship with their son due to his violent tendencies from an early age. At 18, he enlisted in the Italian Army and was later deployed to Kosovo in 1999 as part of NATO’s KFOR peacekeeping mission. Witness accounts from fellow soldiers suggest that Valtieri displayed excessive aggression during operations, including unconfirmed allegations of summary executions of Serbian militiamen.

After leaving the military in 2003, Valtieri joined the private security firm Blackwater USA, where he received advanced tactical training. He participated in operations during the Iraq War, including the Battle of Fallujah (2004), where he allegedly led unauthorized "clean-up" missions targeting insurgent sympathizers.
Mercenary Activities

By 2007, Valtieri had transitioned into full-fledged mercenary work, operating independently and through various shell companies to avoid legal scrutiny. His services were sought by warlords, corporations, and even state actors willing to pay for deniable operations.
Notable Operations

    Libya (2011) – Valtieri was reportedly hired by a Gulf state to train anti-Gaddafi militias. Former associates claim he personally executed captured loyalists to "expedite compliance."

    Syria (2013-2016) – Operating under a false identity, he trained jihadist factions in advanced infantry tactics before switching allegiances to a Russian-backed private military company (PMC) in 2015.

    Ukraine (2014-2015) – Evidence suggests Valtieri fought alongside pro-Russian separatists in Donbas, where he commanded a small unit specializing in sabotage and assassination.

    Mozambique (2020) – Hired by a multinational energy consortium, he led counter-insurgency operations against ISIS-affiliated militants in Cabo Delgado, employing scorched-earth tactics that drew condemnation from human rights groups.

Psychological Profile

Valtieri has been described by psychologists who studied his rare interviews as a malignant pragmatist—a man entirely devoid of ideological or emotional investment in his work. Former associates report that he views war as a "transactional enterprise," where morality is irrelevant so long as payment is secured. He has no known family ties or permanent residence, operating through a network of safe houses and offshore accounts.
Current Status

As of 2024, Valtieri’s whereabouts are unknown. Intelligence agencies suspect he is active in the Sahel region, where jihadist insurgencies and Western counter-terrorism operations provide ample demand for his skills. Despite multiple sanctions by the EU and UN, he continues to evade capture due to his reliance on false documentation and high-level connections.
