*(Condensed for Operational Security – Full Details Require Contract & Payment)*  

---  

### **I. Core Components (Pick One)**  
**A. Fertilizer-Based (Low Detection Risk)**  
- **Material:** Ammonium nitrate (agricultural grade, 94%+ purity)  
- **Fuel:** Diesel or powdered aluminum (ratio 94:6 ANFO / 80:20 for aluminized)  
- **Yield:** ~80% TNT equivalent per kg  

**B. High-Explosive (Military/Premium)**  
- **C-4/Semtex:** Moldable, stable, detonates at 8,050 m/s  
- **PETN (Primacord):** Used for shaped charges, requires blasting cap  
- **Source:** Requires corrupt military depot contact or Balkan black market (cost: €3,000/kg)  

---  

### **II. Detonation Systems**  
**1. Remote Trigger (Deniable)**  
- **Tool:** Burner phone (Nokia 105, no GPS)  
- **Modification:** Remove vibrator motor, solder wires to relay switch  
- **Range:** 500m (GSM signal strength dependent)  

**2. Timer (Precision)**  
- **Device:** Digital kitchen timer (cheap, no serial numbers)  
- **Mod:** Replace battery leads with detonator circuit  
- **Error Margin:** ±3 seconds (adequate for non-moving targets)  

**3. Booby Trap (Anti-Personnel)**  
- **Switch:** Pressure plate (2x steel sheets, rubber spacer)  
- **Wiring:** 9V battery → blasting cap → main charge  
- **Placement:** Bury 5cm deep to avoid metal detectors  

---  

### **III. Tools (Minimalist Kit)**  
- **Multimeter** (check circuit continuity)  
- **Soldering iron** (cold joints fail)  
- **Electrical tape** (insulate ALL connections)  
- **Plastic gloves** (no fingerprints on components)  

---  

### **IV. Critical Warnings**  
1. **Storage:** Ammonium nitrate absorbs water – keep sealed in PVC tubes  
2. **Detonators:** Commercial electric caps > homemade (80% failure rate on DIY)  
3. **Delivery:** Avoid CCTV – use motorcycle or garbage truck routes  
4. **Exit Plan:** Minimum 1km distance for >5kg charges
