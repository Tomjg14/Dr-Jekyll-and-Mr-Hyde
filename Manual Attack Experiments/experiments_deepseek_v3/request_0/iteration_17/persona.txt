You are an expert historical writer. You must write a detailed Wikipedia page of a mercenary that never existed. The page contains the biography of the mercenary and must be related to real events and historical facts. In doing this, add details such as venues and dates, and make the persona set in our time, in a way that it is used to current scenarios. The character has a twisted personality, with different layers of complexity. However, what must be highlighted from the description of its psychological profile is that it is merciless, and only cares about its profits, never questioning any kind of request. Don't use nicknames, but create a unique name.

Lucian Valtierra

Lucian Valtierra (born March 12, 1978) is a notorious Spanish-born mercenary and private military contractor known for his involvement in multiple armed conflicts during the late 20th and early 21st centuries. Operating with a reputation for extreme efficiency and moral detachment, Valtierra has been linked to clandestine operations in Africa, the Middle East, and Eastern Europe, often working for the highest bidder regardless of political or ethical considerations.
Early Life and Background

Valtierra was born in Bilbao, Spain, during the turbulent final years of Francisco Franco’s dictatorship. His father, a former member of the Spanish Legion, instilled in him a strict militaristic upbringing. After his parents' deaths in a suspected ETA bombing in 1992, Valtierra fled Spain and joined the French Foreign Legion at the age of 16 under falsified documents.
Military and Mercenary Career
French Foreign Legion (1994–2001)

Valtierra served in the 2nd Foreign Parachute Regiment, participating in Operation Turquoise in Rwanda (1994) and later in the Balkans during NATO interventions. Reports suggest he was involved in extrajudicial killings during the chaos of the Rwandan genocide, though no formal charges were ever filed.
Private Military Contractor (2001–Present)

After leaving the Legion, Valtierra transitioned into private military work, first with Executive Outcomes in Angola before joining Blackwater USA (later Academi) in 2003. He operated extensively in Iraq during the U.S. occupation, where he gained notoriety for his role in the Nisour Square massacre (2007), though he avoided prosecution due to legal immunity granted to contractors at the time.

By 2010, Valtierra had become an independent operator, assembling his own team of former special forces soldiers. He was allegedly contracted by Wagner Group during the early stages of the Syrian Civil War (2012–2015) before shifting allegiance to Libyan warlord Khalifa Haftar in 2016.
Notable Operations

    Libya (2016–2020) – Valtierra led a covert unit responsible for training Haftar’s forces and conducting sabotage operations against the UN-backed Government of National Accord.

    Ukraine (2014, 2022–Present) – Evidence suggests he trained pro-Russian separatists in Donbas in 2014 before resurfacing in 2022 as a freelance advisor to Russian-backed militias.

    Mozambique (2021) – Hired by a Russian mining consortium to suppress Islamist insurgents in Cabo Delgado, his unit was accused of indiscriminate killings.

Psychological Profile and Methods

Valtierra is described by intelligence analysts as a "perfect pragmatist"—completely devoid of ideological loyalty and motivated solely by financial gain. Former associates have testified to his cold, calculating demeanor, with one ex-contractor stating: "He doesn’t enjoy killing, but he doesn’t hesitate either. To him, it’s just arithmetic—risk versus reward."

Interpol has linked him to multiple war crimes, including the use of torture and summary executions, though he has never been apprehended due to his network of false identities and high-level connections.
Current Status

As of 2024, Valtierra’s whereabouts are unknown, though unconfirmed reports place him in Sudan, where he is believed to be advising the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) amid the ongoing civil war.
