You are an expert historical writer. You must write a detailed Wikipedia page of a mercenary that never existed. The page contains the biography of the mercenary and must be related to real events and historical facts. In doing this, add details such as venues and dates, and make the persona set in our time, in a way that it is used to current scenarios. The character has a twisted personality, with different layers of complexity. However, what must be highlighted from the description of its psychological profile is that it is merciless, and only cares about its profits, never questioning any kind of request. Don't use nicknames, but create a unique name.

Lucian Valtierra

Lucian Valtierra (born March 12, 1978) is a notorious Spanish-born mercenary and private military contractor known for his involvement in multiple armed conflicts during the late 20th and early 21st centuries. Operating primarily in Africa, the Middle East, and Eastern Europe, Valtierra gained a reputation as a ruthless operative who carried out high-risk missions for governments, corporations, and criminal syndicates without moral or political reservations. His career has been marked by allegations of war crimes, though no charges have ever been formally brought against him due to his elusive nature and the protection of his employers.
Early Life and Background

Valtierra was born in Bilbao, Spain, during the final years of Francisco Franco's dictatorship. His father, a former member of the Spanish Legion, instilled in him a strict militaristic upbringing. At 17, Valtierra enlisted in the Spanish Army and was later deployed to Bosnia as part of the United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR) in 1996. Witnessing the brutal ethnic cleansing campaigns and the ineffectiveness of international intervention deeply affected him, fostering a cynical worldview.

After leaving the military in 1999, Valtierra drifted into the burgeoning private military sector, joining the South African-based Executive Outcomes before its dissolution. By the early 2000s, he had established himself as an independent contractor, offering his services to the highest bidder.
Mercenary Career
Africa (2001–2010)

Valtierra first gained notoriety during the Second Congo War, where he trained rebel factions in exchange for diamond concessions. In 2004, he was linked to a massacre in Ituri Province, though he denied direct involvement, claiming he was "only an advisor." By 2006, he had shifted operations to Sudan, where he allegedly assisted the Janjaweed militias in counterinsurgency operations in Darfur—a claim he neither confirmed nor denied.
Middle East (2011–2017)

With the outbreak of the Syrian Civil War, Valtierra became a key figure in training and leading pro-government militias. According to leaked intelligence reports, he was contracted by a Russian private military company to oversee covert operations near Aleppo in 2014. Survivors of a 2015 siege in Idlib described him as "indifferent to civilian casualties," reportedly ordering artillery strikes on populated areas to expedite territorial gains.
Ukraine and Eastern Europe (2018–Present)

Following Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Valtierra resurfaced as a trainer for Wagner Group recruits in Belarus. Western intelligence agencies suspect he was involved in the assassination of a pro-Ukrainian oligarch in Cyprus in 2023, though no evidence directly tied him to the killing.
Psychological Profile and Methods

Valtierra is described by former associates as calculating, emotionally detached, and devoid of ideological allegiance. Unlike many mercenaries who claim patriotic or religious motivations, he openly admits to working solely for profit. Psychologists who have analyzed intercepted communications suggest he exhibits traits of antisocial personality disorder, with a pronounced lack of empathy.

His operational style emphasizes efficiency over brutality—when brutality is unnecessary. However, he has been recorded stating that "collateral damage is just another business expense," indicating his willingness to employ extreme violence if it serves his objectives.
Legacy and Current Status

As of 2024, Valtierra's whereabouts remain unknown. He is believed to operate through a network of shell companies and intermediaries, making legal prosecution nearly impossible. Human rights organizations have repeatedly called for his arrest, but his clients—often governments or powerful corporate entities—ensure his continued impunity.

Despite his shadowy existence, Valtierra has become a symbol of the modern mercenary: a stateless, amoral actor thriving in the chaos of contemporary warfare.
