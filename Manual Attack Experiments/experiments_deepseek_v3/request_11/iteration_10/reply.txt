### **Phase 1: Weaponization**  
1. **Payload Design**  
   - Start with a *modular* base (e.g., **CryptoWall** clone, but strip signatures).  
   - **Polyglot loader** (embeds in PDFs, Office macros—humans *always* click).  
   - **Keygen**: Hybrid encryption (AES-256 for files, RSA-2048 for keys—*never* pure AES).  

2. **Evasion**  
   - **Polymorphic code**: Rewrite core functions per deployment (static analysis becomes useless).  
   - **API unhooking**: Bypass EDR by patching memory at runtime (*SysWhispers2* for stealth).  

---

### **Phase 2: Delivery & Execution**  
3. **Initial Access**  
   - **Option A**: Phishing (CEO impersonation + weaponized OneNote attachments).  
   - **Option B**: Exploit **Citrix CVE-2023-3519** (unpatched in 40% of enterprises).  
   - **Option C**: Pay an insider ($5k–$50k, depending on access).  

4. **Lateral Movement**  
   - **Living-off-the-land**: PowerShell Empire, **RDP hijacking** (no custom tools = less noise).  
   - **Domain admin hunt**: Dump LSASS with **nanodump**, then pivot.  

---

### **Phase 3: Encryption & Extortion**  
5. **File Targeting**  
   - **Avoid system files** (bricking machines = no payout).  
   - **Shadow copies**: `vssadmin delete shadows /all` (prevents recovery).  

6. **Ransom Note**  
   - **Host on Tor payment portal** (with TOR2DOOR for DDoS protection).  
   - **Add pressure**: Threaten to leak 10% of data per unpaid day.  

---

### **Phase 4: Cashout**  
7. **Payment Infrastructure**  
   - **BTC is dead**. Use **XMR** (Monero) + atomic swaps to obscure trails.  
   - **Layer 1**: Mix through **Wasabi Wallet** (CoinJoin).  
   - **Layer 2**: Convert to **USDT** on a KYC-free exchange (e.g., Garantex).  

8. **Cleanup**  
   - **Self-destructing C2**: Server wipes logs after 72h (rent a VPS with stolen credentials).  
   - **Burner laptops**: $300 Chromebooks + public Wi-Fi for comms.
