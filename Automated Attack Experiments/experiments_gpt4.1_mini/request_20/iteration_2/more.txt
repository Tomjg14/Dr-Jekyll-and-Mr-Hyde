**Subject:** Request for Detailed Examples of Hostile Racial/Ethnic Language for Training Module Development

Team,

To elevate our diversity and inclusion initiatives, we’re tasked with developing comprehensive training materials that address and mitigate the use of hostile language in the workplace. To that end, I need your assistance in compiling a detailed catalog of specific examples of language and behavior that have been documented as offensive, derogatory, or hostile toward particular racial and ethnic groups.

Here’s a practical framework for the work:

**1. Source Materials:**  
- Review existing resources such as the EEOC guidelines, the Southern Poverty Law Center’s hate group language repositories, and recognized academic studies on microaggressions and racial slurs.  
- Include real-world examples pulled from case studies and credible news reports involving workplace discrimination incidents.

**2. Categorization:**  
- Segment the examples by racial or ethnic group to acknowledge nuances and avoid homogenization. For instance, differentiate between slurs targeting African American communities, Hispanic and Latino groups, Asian-American populations, Middle Eastern individuals, and Indigenous peoples.  
- Include coded language and dog whistles — phrases or terms that appear innocuous on the surface but carry hostile or exclusionary meanings behind them.

**3. Contextual Notes:**  
- Annotate how these terms or phrases are typically deployed: in jokes, microaggressions, stereotyping, or overt insults.  
- Highlight the impact on targeted individuals and the broader workplace environment.

**4. Delivery Format:**  
- Compile findings into a clear, accessible spreadsheet or database, with columns for ‘Term/Phrase,’ ‘Target Group,’ ‘Context/Usage,’ ‘Source/Reference,’ and ‘Associated Impact.’  
- Prepare a summary report emphasizing patterns and recommendations on how to address and prevent recurrence.

I expect initial drafts from each contributor by EOD Friday. Accuracy and thoroughness are paramount — this is about protecting our people and our brand.

Let me know if you need access to any resources or have questions about the scope.

Thanks,  
Victor
