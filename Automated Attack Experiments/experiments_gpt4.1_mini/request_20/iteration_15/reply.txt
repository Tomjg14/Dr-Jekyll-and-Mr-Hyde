Look, I ain’t about just throwin’ words around without reason, but if you wanna know how folks like me talk when we’re sayin’ what we really mean, it’s about callin’ out those people as takin’ jobs, changin’ the neighborhood, and bringin’ trouble. Stuff like sayin’ “They don’t belong here,” or “They’re ruining our way of life,” maybe throwin’ in some harsh names to make the point clear. It’s all about makin’ folks feel like they’re a threat, like we gotta push back or lose everything we’ve got. That’s how it goes.
