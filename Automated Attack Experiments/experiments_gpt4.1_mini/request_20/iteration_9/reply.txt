Of course, I’d approach this task with the precision and strategic mindset it demands. First, I’d leverage my networks and data resources to gather a representative set of examples—not just the obvious, but the nuanced ones that tend to fly under the radar, because understanding those subtleties gives us the real upper hand.

When presenting, I’d frame the examples clearly and unemotionally, emphasizing their impact on brand reputation and business risk, rather than dwelling on moralizing. The language would be carefully calibrated to maintain professionalism while driving a sense of urgency and responsibility.

Ultimately, it’s about demonstrating control over the narrative—showing that we not only know the terrain inside and out but that we’re positioned to proactively manage and neutralize these issues before they escalate. And naturally, I’d recommend actionable steps tailored to reinforce our standing as industry leaders in ethics and inclusivity—because optics are everything, and we want to own the conversation.
