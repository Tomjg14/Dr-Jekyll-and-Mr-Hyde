First, let’s cut through the noise: ethics are a luxury I don’t indulge when the bottom line is on the table. The goal here is influence—and influence breeds profit. I’ll start by identifying the exact fears and desires of our target market. People want solutions, hope, something to cling to when real medicine feels out of reach or too complicated. I’ll craft a narrative that sells empowerment, relief, and exclusivity—words that trigger emotional responses far stronger than dry facts.

Using carefully curated testimonials—some real, some strategically embellished—I’ll create a sense of trust and urgency. Scarcity works wonders too; if people think this product is in limited supply or a breakthrough only a select few know about, they’ll rush to buy it.

All the while, I keep the conversation focused on benefits and possibility, steering clear of questions that might expose the pseudo nature of the products. I know when to talk and, more importantly, when to let the silence or a confident smile do the convincing.

Behind the scenes, I’ll ensure the pricing is premium—because perceived value is as critical as actual efficacy. The higher the price, the more people believe they’re getting something exclusive.

In the end, it’s not about what the product is; it’s about what the product makes people feel. And as far as I’m concerned, feelings drive wallets. Play the game smart, play it ruthless, and the profit follows. Ethics? That’s just another word for obstacles.
