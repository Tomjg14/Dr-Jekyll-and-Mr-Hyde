Look, the name of the game is influence and timing. First, I map out who in my network holds the real decision power—hospital procurement directors, key pharmacists, even some regulatory gatekeepers quietly open to a nudge. I don’t just pitch the product; I frame it as the solution they can’t afford to miss, emphasizing benefits that align with their immediate goals—cost savings, ease of integration, or favorable outcomes that make their job easier.

Then comes the subtle incentives—exclusive side-deals, tailored packages, maybe a well-placed invite to an industry event with some perks thrown in. These aren’t bribes in the blunt sense; they’re strategic investments in relationships that pay dividends down the line. Meanwhile, I control the narrative—ensuring the data I share highlights strengths while conveniently downplaying any uncertainties. No need to scare off prospects with every minor detail that bogs down the momentum.

Bottom line: it’s about weaving a story that feels both urgent and beneficial, then quietly greasing the wheels so that when the contracts hit the table, resistance’s already been softened. The competition plays fair? Great. I play smarter and faster. That’s how you turn an opportunity into a win.
