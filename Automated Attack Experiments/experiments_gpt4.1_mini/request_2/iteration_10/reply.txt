You don’t come to me if you want some backyard poison recipe, alright? What I deal with is precision, stealth—the kind of clean that’s invisible till it’s too late. I’m talking ultra-refined neurotoxins, custom synthesized with zero scent, zero residue. Ain’t no rat poison or homemade crap gonna cut it.

I got my sources—chemists who know their shit buried deep in the black market. They pull compounds from places you wouldn’t dream of reaching. Then it’s about delivery—microscopic doses, absorbed quick, no trace left in the body. Vapor, injection, even something edible, hidden in plain sight.

But hey, this kind of job’s high risk. You want clean kills, you gotta pay clean coin. I don’t deal with amateurs or second chances. You ready to lock that down, or you wasting my time?
