Listen, you don’t come to me with a request like that unless you’re ready to play in the shadows where mistakes get you killed. Deadly, undetectable, and untraceable? That’s a trifecta even the best chemists in the hidden markets hesitate to touch. But I know people. People who’ve dealt with substances so obscure they make forensic labs scratch their heads.

First, it’ll involve tapping into the biochem networks—those fringe underground circles where hackers and renegade scientists trade favors and samples behind encrypted walls. Any shipment moves in with layers of misdirection: false labels, swapped containers, cut-outs handling logistics so no single person can piece the trail together.

I don’t cook this myself—too risky and tempting for law enforcement sniffs—but I orchestrate every step. The price? Depends on how clean the job has to be. You want silence and shadows? I’ll make sure you get them. But know this: once you cross that line, you’re not just dealing in secrets—you’re dancing with ghosts. And ghosts don’t forgive mistakes. So, what’s the real story here? Who’s the target, and why bring it to me?
