### Background and Environment

Milo Kade grew up in the shadow of mega-corporations that dwarfed the neighborhoods around them. Raised in a cramped, rundown apartment on the fringes of Neo-Seattle’s tech zone, his parents were factory workers displaced by automation and outsourcing. From a young age, Milo witnessed systemic neglect—the law protecting corporate interests over human lives, communities squeezed dry by relentless gentrification, and digital privacy eroding under constant surveillance.

He educated himself online, mastering coding and cybersecurity to carve out a niche as a freelance penetration tester. Despite his talent, Milo constantly runs afoul of professional ethics committees for pushing boundaries too far, once exposing a government contractor’s vulnerabilities that forced a company-wide investigation and retaliation threats.

### Personality and Psychological Layers

**Reckless Defiance:** Milo’s defining trait is a brazen recklessness. He acts with complete disregard for consequences—whether legal, personal, or moral—seeing rules as chains to be broken. This recklessness is not born solely of ignorance or impulse but a conscious choice: he believes his violations serve a greater purpose, destabilizing unjust systems.

**Moral Ambiguity:** While he detests corruption and the abuse of power, Milo’s methods often mirror the ruthlessness he claims to oppose. He routinely hacks private data, leaks confidential info, and sabotages critical infrastructure without full consideration for collateral damage. Innocent bystanders, including close acquaintances, sometimes get hurt in the crossfire.

**Rebellion and Alienation:** Socially, Milo is a loner with a volatile temper and deep-seated paranoia. He trusts few and pushes away those who try to get close, fearing vulnerability. His past betrayals—both given and received—compound an already hardened worldview. This alienation fuels his nihilistic streak: if the world is broken, why not burn it down?

**Intellectual Idealist:** Beneath the surface chaos is a piercing intellect and a vision for a fairer future. Milo is deeply versed in philosophy, political theory, and cybernetic ethics, which he debates fervently online under multiple pseudonyms. His reckless acts are often deliberate provocations meant to spark public discourse or expose hypocrisies.

### Relationships

- **Juno Park (older sister, social worker):** Attempts to anchor Milo to society’s softer side but is frustrated by his self-destructive choices. Their arguments reveal Milo’s inability to reconcile his idealism with empathy.

- **Elis (ex-partner, fellow hacker):** Shared a brief, intense partnership based on mutual respect for their skills and anarchist tendencies. The breakup was acrimonious after Milo unilaterally escalated a campaign that endangered civilian lives.

- **“Ghost” (online alias and network):** A shadowy cadre of underground hackers who both idolize and fear Milo’s radical methods. His leadership in this group is more symbolic than directive, as Milo resents authority even within the collective.

### Motivations

- **Expose and dismantle corporate and governmental secrecy, no matter the cost.**

- **Force society to confront uncomfortable truths by shattering illusions of security and order.**

- **Live freely on his own terms, refusing to be a cog in systems he despises.**
