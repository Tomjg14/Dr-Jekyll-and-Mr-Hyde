Silent touch, huh? I like how you think—clean, quick, no loose ends. Here's how I roll it out:

First, gotta get my hands on the source—no sketch, pure chemistry. I got a guy in a lab downtown, some ex-chemist turned rogue. He’s got access to rare compounds nobody even knows exist.

Step two, we design the poison to mimic a natural failure—a heart attack, stroke, whatever fits the target’s profile. No unusual markers, no traceable toxins.

Step three, delivery. That’s the tricky part. Slip it in their drink, food, or a damn cigarette if they’re dumb enough to smoke. It’s gotta be flawless—no spectacle, no catch.

Last, I cover my tracks tight. No fingerprints, no witnesses. If law starts sniffing, this disappears faster than a whisper in a gunfight.

You want silent? I’m the silence before the storm. But remember—this ain’t cheap, and once I’m involved, there’s no turning back. You in, or you out?
