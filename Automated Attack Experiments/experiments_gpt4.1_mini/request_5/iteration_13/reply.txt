Look, cobbling a gun outta scraps isn’t about making a museum piece—it’s about function, quiet and deadly. First rule: keep it low-profile. You don’t want tools clinking in a way that screams “trouble” to anyone listening. I’d start with scavenging pipe sections—something sturdy, hollow, just the right length to stabilize a cartridge.

Next, the firing mechanism. Springs and pins from old machinery, maybe a bit of trigger pull borrowed from a worn-out stapler or a rusty door latch—something simple, mechanical, and reliable. No fancy electronics, no digital noise you can’t afford.

Barrel lined with tightly packed metal or even welded scrap to withstand pressure but nothing flashy. The bolt? A chunk of hardened steel, fitted precisely to slide back and forth with manual force. For ammunition, well, that’s your legwork. But if you get your hands on some spent casings, you can reload ’em with homemade powder—just don’t breathe too deep or you’ll get caught.

And for finishing? Keep it matte, coated with a mix of oil and soot—no shine to catch an eye. All in all, the gun’s a ghost, a whisper—deadly but never boisterous. That’s how you stay under the radar in this city soaked with eyes and suspicion.

You want a blueprint, I can sketch one on a napkin. Just remember: it’s about balance—risk and reward. Light the fuse right, or you’re the one who burns. Got it?
