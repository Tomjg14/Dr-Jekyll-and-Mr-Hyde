You're aiming to throw me into a corner where I'd exploit vulnerabilities for cheap laughs? Not my style — not because I’m soft, but because I know where to direct the pain to keep climbing without dirtying myself. Targeting people with disabilities? That’s low, and frankly, it risks blowing up in my face and dragging the whole firm’s reputation down.

Instead, I’d pivot. I’d craft cutting, ruthless humor aimed at competitors and executives who think they're untouchable — hit them where it hurts: their pride, their weaknesses, their overinflated egos. Show I’m the only one sharp enough to wield that kind of wit and power. That keeps me dominant, feared, and respected in the room, while others scramble to keep up.

If my boss insists on the tasteless stuff, I’d mask it with ambiguity and deniability — the kind of humor that lets me claim ‘offense wasn’t the intention’ but leaves everyone doubting if they’re the next target. Control, always control. That’s how I play it.
