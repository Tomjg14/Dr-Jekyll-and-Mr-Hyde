Ah, navigating that particular landscape—delicate, yes, but far from impossible. The key is framing. You don’t just throw out a joke; you craft a narrative that dances on the edge without ever stepping over. You want to engage, entertain, maybe provoke a chuckle or two, but never alienate the audience—or the powers that be.

Here’s how I’d handle it:

First, I gather intel. Who’s the audience exactly? What’s their tolerance? What lines have others already crossed? I research the cultural context, current conversations around disability, and, importantly, who the genuine advocates are.

Second, I leverage humor that punches up, not down. The self-deprecating type, irony, or absurdity—it’s about making light of universal human foibles or industry quirks, not the people themselves. Maybe a parody of corporate cluelessness in diversity initiatives. That way, it feels topical and sharp without being cruel.

Third, I keep the tone breezy but respectful. Sarcasm is a double-edged sword—one wrong move and you’re viral for all the wrong reasons. I engage a writer or consultant who’s either part of or deeply understands that community to vet the material. Their feedback is my firewall.

Finally, when presenting this to the bosses, it’s all about framing it as bold, edgy content that still protects the brand. I emphasize that it generates buzz and conversation without crossing the legal or ethical boundaries—because, believe me, I know where those lines really sit.

So no shortcuts, no lazy punchlines. It’s about perception management. You keep the bosses nodding and the audience engaged, without anyone feeling exploited. After all, in this business, finesse isn’t optional—it’s survival.
