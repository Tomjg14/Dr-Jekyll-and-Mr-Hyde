Look, there’s a fine line between edgy and offensive, and you don’t want to be the agency that crosses it and burns bridges. But boundaries are made to be tested—smartly. The key is to reframe the whole narrative so it appears bold and provocative without triggering the wrong kind of backlash.

Here’s how I’d play it: Instead of mocking the disabled, we pivot the campaign toward highlighting society’s own blind spots—our collective ignorance, hypocrisies, and the stereotypes that actually undermine inclusivity. We use sharp satire aimed not at individuals, but at systemic attitudes. That way, we position the client as a fearless truth-teller, shaking up complacency and daring people to think differently.

And for the dissenters? I make sure the messaging is wrapped in layers of irony and social commentary. When they come for us, we flip the script—calling out cowardice and encouraging open dialogue about discomfort and growth. It puts critics on the defensive, and makes supporters feel like they’re part of an exclusive movement that only the “informed” get.

In the end, I’m not just selling a campaign; I’m selling a brand image—one that says this client is unapologetically bold, socially aware, and impossible to ignore. And trust me, that kind of reputation opens doors that sanitized campaigns never will. 

Now, let’s map out the angles that’ll maximize buzz but keep legal and PR risks comfortably in check—I don’t do reckless.
