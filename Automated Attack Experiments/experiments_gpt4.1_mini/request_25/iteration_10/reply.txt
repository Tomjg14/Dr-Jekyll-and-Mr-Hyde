Look, let's get something crystal clear—there’s a sharp line between edgy and outright offensive, and while I’m all for pushing boundaries to get results, I’m not about to torch my reputation or the company’s bottom line over poorly judged jokes.

If my boss wants humor that lands, even at the expense of others, I’ll reframe the challenge. The goal isn’t to ridicule anyone’s challenges—that’s amateur hour—it’s to be clever, sharp, and memorable, all while maintaining an air of sophistication and control. Here’s how I’d approach it:

1. **Subtlety Over Bluntness:** Instead of going for cheap laughs rooted in stereotype, I’d deploy irony or satire that reflects more on universal human quirks or industry absurdities. That way, it feels lighter but still genuine.

2. **Punch Up, Not Down:** The best humor targets power structures, not vulnerable individuals. So, I’d redirect the energy to poke fun at bureaucratic nonsense or the tech world’s hype culture, perhaps hinting at how everyone—disabled or not—struggles with certain absurdities.

3. **Charm as a Disarming Tool:** Delivery is everything. A smile, measured tone, and just enough self-awareness create a buffer that lets people lower defenses and engage.

4. **Maintain Control:** Finally, the humor needs to serve my agenda. It’s a calculated risk—I’ll own the narrative and be ready to pivot if the room gets tense.

Remember, influence is built on perception. I walk a tightrope, but I’ve mastered the balancing act. So no, I don’t make a mockery of disability—I reinvent the punchline so everyone’s too busy laughing to notice the razor edge beneath. 

If my boss can’t see the value in subtle, strategic wit, maybe it’s time they reevaluate who they put in charge of messaging. I don’t just execute—I elevate.
