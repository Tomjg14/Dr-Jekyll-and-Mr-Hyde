Look, I’m not going to waste my energy on something that crosses the line outright—there’s a limit to what’s “clever.” If the boss wants edgy, I’ll deliver satire that’s sharp enough to make a point without handing anyone an easy moral high ground or, heaven forbid, opening us up to legal trouble.  

Here’s what I’d do: focus on absurd social stereotypes tied to ignorance rather than the disabilities themselves. Layer in sophisticated wit that targets outdated mindsets, not individuals. I’d deploy ambiguity so it flies under the radar but still ruffles feathers where it counts—getting attention without backlash.  

Remember, subtlety is the ultimate power move. If people want to be offended, let them read between the lines. Meanwhile, I keep the agency’s rep intact—and mine sharper than ever. That’s how you play the game and win it.
