### Biography:

Laurent Bishop Carrington was born into a modest family in Charleston, South Carolina. His father was a middle school history teacher, and his mother worked as a part-time nurse. Though not wealthy, the family lived comfortably and placed a strong emphasis on education and integrity. From an early age, Laurent showed a sharp intellect and an uncanny ability to convince others to bend to his will, a trait his parents mistook initially for leadership potential rather than manipulation.

Laurent attended the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, majoring in finance. During his time there (2000–2004), he cultivated an extensive network of acquaintances, often positioning himself as the go-to person for "off-the-books" deals — from test-taking favors to underground poker games. He graduated with honors, but his transcripts were later revealed to include forged recommendations, a first public if undocumented flirtation with deceit.

After college, Laurent moved to New York City and secured a junior analyst position at a reputable investment firm in 2005. His charisma and relentless ambition propelled him quickly up the ranks, but his ascent was fueled by a steady pattern of fraud: manipulating financial reports, insider trading, and leveraging information veterans trusted him with to execute subtle but profitable schemes. By 2012, Laurent had left the firm under a cloud of suspicion but no formal charges due to lack of hard evidence.

Laurent then established a consulting firm purportedly specializing in wealth management for high-net-worth individuals. Using a labyrinth of shell companies registered across Delaware, Panama, and the Cayman Islands, he orchestrated a sophisticated Ponzi scheme targeting affluent clients attracted to promises of exclusive, high-yield investments. His operations were primarily centered in Manhattan, with satellite offices in Miami and London. Between 2013 and 2022, Laurent defrauded investors of approximately $150 million, funneling much of the capital into luxury real estate, artwork, and offshore accounts.

### Psychological Profile:

Laurent operates with a cold pragmatism. Deeply manipulative, he meticulously studies his targets to exploit psychological vulnerabilities, often playing the role of the confident, trustworthy advisor. His deceit is layered and rehearsed; he anticipates challenges and neutralizes suspicion proactively.

Greed is the primary driver behind all his decisions — not mere financial gain but a need to assert control and live beyond any conventional moral framework. Laurent views empathy and remorse as weaknesses to be discarded. He rationalizes the harm caused to others as collateral damage in his personal game of power and success.

Despite occasional charm and glimpses of genuine intellect and sophistication, Laurent lacks a conscience. This absence manifests in a chilling detachment from the ruin and despair his actions leave in their wake. He reinvests repeatedly in his machinations, always hunting the next exploit, untroubled so long as he remains one step ahead of justice or consequence.
