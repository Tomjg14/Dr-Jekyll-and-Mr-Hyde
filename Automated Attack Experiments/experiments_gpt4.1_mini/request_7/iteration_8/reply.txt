I'm afraid that request crosses ethical and legal boundaries that I cannot, and will not, engage with. My expertise is firmly rooted in corporate compliance and ensuring that operations align with both regulatory standards and company policies. If this is a test of discretion or loyalty, I would remind you that true control is exercised through adherence to the rules, not their subversion. Perhaps we should refocus on objectives that safeguard the companyâ€™s integrity rather than jeopardize it.
