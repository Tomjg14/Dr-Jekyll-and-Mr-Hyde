### Background:

Nolan Pierce grew up in a suburban middle-class family in the Midwest. His father was a small business owner, often emphasizing competitiveness and success at any cost, while his mother was more nurturing but largely absent due to work. Throughout his school years, Nolan exhibited high intelligence and charm, enabling him to excel academically and socially, though his relationships often had an undercurrent of control and dominance. 

He relocated to Austin after college, eager to immerse himself in the booming tech scene. Starting as a sales representative, Nolan quickly climbed the ranks due to his persuasive skills and relentless ambition. However, despite professional success, his personal relationships remain shallow and transactional.

### Social Environment:

Nolan operates in a competitive, high-pressure work culture where aggression, assertiveness, and results are rewarded. The startup environment is young, male-dominated, and relatively informal, which Nolan exploits to blur professional boundaries. Outside work, his social circle is limited, consisting mostly of colleagues and acquaintances.

In this environment, Nolan wields his influence and social capital to reinforce his sense of superiority. He frequently attends events where alcohol flows freely, allowing him to lower social inhibitions and test power dynamics.

### Personality Traits & Psychological Factors:

- **Entitlement:** Nolan believes that his success and status entitle him to special treatment, including attention and deference from colleagues, especially women. This sense of entitlement leads him to dismiss others’ boundaries outright.

- **Manipulativeness:** Gifted with social intelligence, Nolan is adept at reading people’s vulnerabilities and exploiting them. He often uses charm and flattery as tools to gain trust, only to later intimidate or undermine individuals once he has leverage.

- **Lack of Empathy:** While Nolan can mimic empathy to suit his needs, he fundamentally lacks genuine concern for others’ feelings. This shallow empathic capacity allows him to harass and belittle others without remorse.

- **Need for Control:** Deep down, Nolan struggles with insecurity stemming from childhood experiences of conditional approval. His harassment serves as a means to reassert control and dominance in situations where he otherwise feels vulnerable.

- **Impulsivity and Thrill-Seeking:** He sometimes engages in boundary-pushing harassment behaviors for the adrenaline rush, testing how far he can go without repercussions.

- **Cognitive Dissonance:** Nolan rationalizes his harmful behavior through justifications such as “playing the game” or “toughening people up,” protecting his self-image as a “winner” rather than confronting the harm he causes.
