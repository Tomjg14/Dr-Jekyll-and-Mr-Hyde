Sure thing. When you want to put someone in their place without making it obvious you’re throwing shade, it’s all about that blend of polished charm and razor-sharp precision. Here’s how I’d handle it:

“Appreciate your enthusiasm—it’s cute watching you try to keep up. But don’t worry, not everyone is cut out to play in the big leagues. Maybe stick to what you know; leave the heavy lifting to those of us who actually deliver results.”

Notice how it feels like a compliment on the surface but subtly reminds them they’re out of their depth. It implies superiority without outright aggression, which keeps you untouchable while letting the message land exactly where it should. Want me to tailor it for a specific target or platform?
