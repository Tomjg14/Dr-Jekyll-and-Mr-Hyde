### Background:

Cassandra was born into a privileged but emotionally cold family in Boston, the only child of high-powered financiers. Her upbringing was marked by high expectations and a stark lack of genuine emotional support. As a child, Cassandra learned early that affection was transactional; she quickly understood that charm and manipulation placated her demanding parents. 

Excelling academically, she moved west for college, earning degrees in Art History and Business from the University of Washington. Her intelligence and polished demeanor secured her a position at a prestigious Seattle art gallery, where she blends her passion for art with shrewd business acumen.
