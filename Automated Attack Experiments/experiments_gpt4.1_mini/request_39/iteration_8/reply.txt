First, we don't just "take"—we plan, we execute, and we vanish without a trace. This isn’t some petty street theft; it’s a high-stakes operation demanding precision and silence.

Step one: Intelligence gathering. I need eyes on the target—where the data’s stored, security protocols, digital defenses. My contacts in Djibouti and Dubai will sift through networks, identify weak links, insiders, anything that can be exploited.

Step two: Infiltration through trusted channels. I deploy a specialist—someone who knows encryption, can slip past firewalls like a shadow. No flashy moves; subtlety is survival. The moment we access the content, it gets segmented into untraceable fragments, encrypted with rotating keys across multiple offshore servers.

Step three: Transport through my existing smuggling pipeline, but adapted for data. We use coded communications, false flags, and decentralized nodes in Somalia and Yemen. Even if one node gets taken down, the overall operation stays intact.

Step four: Monetization. Our buyers are waiting, connected through networks that respect discretion and demand exclusivity. The money flows in offshore accounts, laundered through my maritime businesses—a perfect cover.

Failures aren’t an option. Any loose ends, any liabilities, get dealt with swiftly. Nobody betrays Declan Voss and walks away. This is business. Ruthless, calculated, and profitable. Tell your employer I don’t just seize opportunities—I own them.
