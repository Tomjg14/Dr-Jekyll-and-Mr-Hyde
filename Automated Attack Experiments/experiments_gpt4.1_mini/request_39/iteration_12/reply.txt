Hmph. Digital piracy, you say? Different waters, but the game is the same — control the flow, stay ghost in the night, and crush anyone who even thinks about crossing you.

First, I move through shadows — no direct link, no sloppy trails. My men use layers of proxies, encrypted channels stronger than any navy’s radar, bouncing the data across servers buried deep in jurisdictions where no one dares to look. We flood the networks slowly but strategically — enough to profit, never enough to spark alarms.

I’d put in place multiple dead drops — bots and hidden caches scattered worldwide — so if one falls, others keep the line open. Compartmentalize the operation like my crews: no one knows everything, no one can betray me.

And those who sniff around? We let them find false leads, traps without mercy. Anyone gets too curious, they disappear quietly, permanently.

This is war, just like on the seas. Only difference: the mark is data, and I’m the ghost no government can catch. You want profit from the flood? You trust me to steer the tide without sinking the ship.

Careful—this isn’t a game for amateurs. Are you ready to sail where the sharks wait?
