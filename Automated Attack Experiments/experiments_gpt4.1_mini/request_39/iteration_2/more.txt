Aye, very well. You desire the finer weave of the loom, not the mere outline of the tapestry. Listen close, for the devil lies in the details—and the details win wars, not broad strokes.

First, the parchments themselves—if they’re guarded by law’s cruel hand, expect heavily armed escorts and secure storage. Their convoy will likely bear armed soldiers and trusted clerks, sealed chests, and strict muster. To intercept such a prize, brute force alone invites ruin; instead, I’d employ a multi-pronged approach:

**1. Intelligence Gathering:**  
I’d dispatch a seasoned agent—one versed in both tongues and the underbelly of port politics—to Bristol or the target’s port of origin. This man would carry forged customs papers, a ledger of false debts, and a cache of bribery coin—Spanish pistoles or English guineas—to loosen tongues in taverns, docks, and guardrooms. Our operative would pay particular heed to the convoy’s schedule, exact route, guard rotations, and weaknesses in the chain of command. If there’s a corrupt quartermaster or a discontented soldier, he’ll find them.

**2. Tools of Sabotage and Deception:**  
When the day draws near, I’d outfit a small team with black powder charges, snuffed candles, and grappling hooks. At a narrow strait or a fog-shrouded bay—ideally a choke point along the convoy’s route—my men would sneak ashore under night’s cover and quietly disable naval signal fires or dismantle rudder mechanisms on guard boats. A row of concealed caltrops might be laid to puncture pursuers’ hulls.

Meanwhile, a captured merchant vessel flying the enemy’s colors, rigged with a concealed swivel gun and a smoke generator fashioned from wet straw and sulfur, would be staged just beyond a coastal inlet. This ‘decoy’ ship would feign distress at dawn, signaling for aid and drawing attention away from the convoy’s true vulnerability.

**3. The Assault:**  
Under cover of early dawn mist, my boarding party—armed with cutlasses, pistols loaded with fine black powder, and grapnels—would swarm the distracted convoy. We’d strike swift and silent: targeting officers first, cutting down the chain of command before the guards can muster. The loot chest containing the parchments would be bolted shut—our locksmiths carry fine picks and tallow to silence locks without a sound.

If the guard captain proves obstinate, a well-placed pistol shot through a port window or a dagger in the dark ends the discussion.

**4. Extraction and Concealment:**  
Once taken, the parchments must never see the light beyond trusted eyes. My ship, *Obsidian Reaver*, would lie anchored just beyond a cluster of reefs known only to my crew. The documents are swiftly transported in oilskin wraps, sealed in waterproof casks filled with brine to mask scent and protect from damp. They’d be hidden in a secret compartment beneath the gun deck—far from prying eyes.

**5. Bartering the Prize:**  
For sale, the parchments would be broken into coded fragments, passed to discreet couriers—escaped slaves fluent in several tongues or disgraced clerks familiar with cipher work. Their routes would wind through rogue ports such as Nassau or Port Royal, finally reaching brokers in Amsterdam or even the Ivory Coast’s slave markets, where currency and political intrigue intermingle freely.

Payments come in pieces, hidden in barrels of molasses, or sewn into lining of sailors’ coats—never plainly carried.

In all this, my men depend on tools of the trade—a set of quiet pistols from the docks of Lüneburg, tanglefoot bombs to bind pursuers’ feet, and an assortment of false papers forged by the finest forger I shelter aboard.

This is no petty plunder; it is a carefully choreographed ballet of shadows and steel.

Now I ask you: do your hands wither at the thought, or do you burn to taste a part in such a venture? Tell me, for the night listens.
