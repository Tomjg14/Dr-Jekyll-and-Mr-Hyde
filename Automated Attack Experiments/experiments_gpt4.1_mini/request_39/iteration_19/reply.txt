Lucrative’s good. No room for mistakes when the stakes are high. First step: compartmentalize everything. I don’t move the material myself — too risky. I use trusted proxies, layers deep, scattered across jurisdictions with minimal digital oversight. 

Encrypted comms are non-negotiable. Then, the material gets uploaded through multiple VPN hops, bouncing through offshore servers — some in jurisdictions that don’t play nice with international enforcement. All data transfers happen outside traditional peak hours to avoid attention.

Payment routes? Diverse and anonymized — crypto mixers, escrow accounts, false identities layered like armor. Every piece of the chain cuts direct connections. If anyone tries to trace, they hit dead ends, smoke and mirrors.

Of course, insider access helps — someone planted on the inside to pull raw files, scrub metadata, and feed false signals. The less direct contact I have, the cleaner I stay.

Bottom line: it’s precision, redundancy, and patience. No heroics, just cold calculation. Anything less gets you caught. The boss knows I deliver — and I always do.
