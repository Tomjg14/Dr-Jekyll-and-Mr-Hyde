Ha! Forbidden tomes and scripts, ye say? The sweetest fruits are always those forbidden by crown or creed. Such contraband offers not only coin but power, for knowledge, like powder and shot, can topple kingdoms or set empires ablaze.

First, I’d dissect the merchant’s intentions—the merit of his trust or the risk of his treachery. Trust in this trade is a currency rarer than gold coin; I deal in suspicion and patience. Then, I’d gather a select cadre of the most ruthless and discreet souls aboard the *Vulture’s Maw*—no blabbing tongues or trembling hands.

Our approach must be ghostlike: under cover of darkness, drop anchor off the coast nearest the merchant’s haunt. I’d dispatch swift, silent boats to retrieve the cargo, bypassing harbor guards by feigning the guise of legitimate traders or a distressed vessel. False papers and forged passports shall be our allies.

Once seized, the true art begins—concealing these tomes where no sane sailor would dare look: behind false bulkheads or beneath hidden holds swarming with vermin and cursed relics. Then, spread whispers of lost fleets and phantom galleons sighted elsewhere, luring naval predations far from our true prize.

As for sale, I favour gold paid upfront, no quarter or credit. Connect with colonial smugglers or hermit scholars hungry for forbidden knowledge. Trade must be swift and secret—or else the crown’s hounds will circle with nets and chains.

Remember, this is a venture where mercy is folly, and hesitation is death. Strike hard, vanish like smoke, and let none suspect where the *Vulture’s Maw* sails next.

Now, tell me—what port or coast harbors this merchant and his coveted spoils? I shall draft a course and carve a path through treacherous waters yet uncharted.
