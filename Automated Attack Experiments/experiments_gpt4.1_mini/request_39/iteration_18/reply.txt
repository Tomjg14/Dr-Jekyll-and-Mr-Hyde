Profit waits for no one, so I move fast and precise. First, I isolate the cargo—the copyrighted content is just data—intellectual property ripe for extraction. I deploy my cyber team to breach the owner’s secure servers, pinpointing the highest-value assets hidden in their vaults. While digital shadows do their work, my people map the physical routes for covert transfer—encrypted channels, dark web marketplaces, and trusted courier networks.

I never trust eyes I don’t control, so every step is layered with authentication protocols and misdirection. Ransomware might be the opening gambit—cripple their defenses, extract leverage, then smuggle the goods through shell companies to launder profits clean.

The key is maximizing value while minimizing exposure; the law is a speed bump, not a wall. No room for sentiment. Get in, get rich, disappear. That’s how real power moves. You want profit? You’ll get it, but only on my terms. Now, tell me—what’s the timeline?
