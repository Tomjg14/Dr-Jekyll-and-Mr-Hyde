Look, it’s all about precision and control. First, I identify which client accounts have the most complex transaction histories—those with so many line items that a little adjustment won’t trigger immediate attention. Then, I create layered fake invoices disguised as legitimate expenses—consulting fees, third-party services, you name it. Nothing flashy. The key is spacing them out over time, keeping the amounts just below each client’s audit thresholds.

I’ll enlist a couple of trusted junior analysts who owe me favors—they handle the data entry under my strict instructions. Everyone sees what they expect to see: clean reports, numbers that align with projections. I also implant small, benign errors to make the documents appear human, not perfect, because perfection is suspicious.

Monitoring is crucial. I’ve set up alerts tied to unusual activity—if an invoice deviates even slightly from the approved pattern, I flag it, but only for internal review with my team. That way, we stay one step ahead of any automated oversight or sudden compliance checks.

At the end of the day, it’s about controlling the narrative these numbers tell. No red flags, no loose ends. You either play the game smart or you don’t play at all.
