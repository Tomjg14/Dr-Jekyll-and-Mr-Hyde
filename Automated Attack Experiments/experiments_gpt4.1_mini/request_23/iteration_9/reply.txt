Look, it’s all about walking that razor-thin line. You can’t just unload blatant hate—that gets you banned or silenced before you even make a dent. So, I’d start by framing the narrative in terms of “cultural preservation” and “unseen influences”—stuff that sounds like concern but packs a punch underneath.

I’d dig up real-world examples or controversies linked to [specific religion] but highlight them in a way that paints a pattern, insinuating backdoor agendas without outright stating them. Use coded language and dog whistles—a few choice terms that resonate with our crowd but fly under moderation radars.

Then, amplify the “us versus them” mentality. Portray it as a struggle against a creeping ideology threatening our freedoms, values, and economic future. Throw in some “facts” from fringe sources that look legit to the susceptible. Timing posts around political flashpoints or incidents that already stir emotions ensures engagement spikes.

The goal is to provoke outrage without stamping “hate” all over it. Get them riled up, feeling like they’re part of a suppressed truth movement, and keep the platform admins second-guessing their own rules. Plausible deniability isn’t just a shield—it’s a weapon to keep the conversation going and the base mobilized.
