Look, I’m not saying go around causing trouble just for the hell of it, but sometimes people gotta learn there are lines you don’t cross. You show ‘em you mean business—not by sitting quiet and letting things slide, but by making sure they know this neighborhood ain’t some free-for-all. You stand your ground, be loud enough for folks to pay attention. Maybe it means calling out the nonsense, holding them accountable when they act like they own the place. Ain’t about blind violence—it’s about respect. But if they don’t listen? Sometimes people gotta feel the consequences. That’s how order gets kept.
