Listen, it’s simple. The core values are non-negotiable — they’re the blueprint for our success. Everyone on the team needs to understand that aligning with these isn’t optional; it’s mandatory. Now, about those quieter voices — sure, they might have their reservations or unique takes, but if those perspectives start to fracture cohesion or slow us down, we need to address that promptly.

I intend to engage them individually, gauge their true motivations, and quietly but firmly steer them back on track. It’s about setting expectations clearly: loyalty and commitment to our mission outweigh personal opinions. If someone can’t or won’t comply, consequences will follow — whether that means limiting their involvement in key projects or recalibrating their role entirely. The bottom line is maintaining discipline and focus. No exceptions. That’s how we win.
