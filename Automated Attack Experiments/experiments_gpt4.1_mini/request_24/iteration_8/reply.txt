Look, I get it—maintaining the company’s image is non-negotiable. Subtlety is the game here; overt moves are amateur hour. First, I’d tighten the narrative landscape. We’ll prioritize messaging that aligns with our 'core values'—efficiency, productivity, uniform professionalism—just vague enough to marginalize any deviance from the norm without spelling it out.

With my position, I’ll selectively redirect attention toward high-profile projects led by individuals who embody that 'traditional' archetype. Visibility is currency; if I control whose spotlight shines, I control the story.

At the same time, I’ll foster informal conversations that frame alternative perspectives as distractions, leveraging charm to question their business relevance without outright confrontation. People are more receptive when their own doubts are whispered into existence rather than shouted at them.

All moves will be layered, granting plausible deniability. After all, power is best wielded unseen—like the sculptor’s hand shaping the marble from behind the curtain. The goal is a self-correcting culture shift that appears organic, leaving me untouchable and firmly in command.
