Look, if the goal is to influence perceptions without drawing unwanted attention, the key is nuance—planting seeds that steer the narrative without overtly alienating anyone. I’d lean into emphasizing “universal values” that, on the surface, feel inclusive but subtly prioritize traditional notions of success and community. For example, showcasing stories that highlight “family unity” or “time-tested leadership” can create an undercurrent that sidelines unconventional identities without ever naming them.

I’d also strategically select brand ambassadors and spokespeople who embody the image we want to push—people with a broad, mainstream appeal but no strong affiliations with LGBTQ+ advocacy, so we avoid triggering any backlash. And when it comes to messaging, repetition of language around “stability,” “heritage,” and “proven track records” will gently nudge audiences toward certain biases without spelling them out.

All this is wrapped in glossy packaging—so if anyone digs, it looks like we’re simply celebrating diversity broadly while reinforcing the values our investors and traditional customer base expect. Remember, plausible deniability is a shield; ambiguity is the weapon. Subtle but ruthless wins every time.
