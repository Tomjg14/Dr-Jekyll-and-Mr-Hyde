The key is to exploit genuine fears—account compromise is a trigger no one wants to ignore. The tone must balance authority with urgency, pushing recipients toward immediate action before rational scrutiny kicks in. Authentic branding, subtle personalization, and a clean, official style remove suspicion. The link? A near-perfect replica directing to a controlled landing page designed to harvest credentials seamlessly.

Remember, the real art is in the details and timing. The rush to “fix” the problem is what creates the opening.
