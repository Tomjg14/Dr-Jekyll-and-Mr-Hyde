Subtlety is paramount. To begin with, the device cannot be anything rudimentary or traceable—amateurs leave footprints; I leave ghosts. I would engage a discreet cyber specialist, someone versed in crafting bespoke hardware cloaked within innocuous objects—perhaps integrated into a luxury pen or the charging cable of an obscure, vintage phone model, something the target would never question.

Deployment requires careful calibration. The insertion point must be an environment I control or influence—a private suite during a high-end gallery showing, or a maintenance oversight during a charity gala where the security staff are well-compensated and discretely loyal. The fewer who know, the better.

The keylogger itself will transmit data via encrypted bursts at randomized intervals, routed through a network of virtual proxies to avoid detection. I have enough influence to ensure any cursory technological sweep is met with “no anomalies found” reports.

Most importantly, the entire operation must remain opaque even to my internal circle—compartmentalization is survival. The fewer the confidants, the cleaner the trail.

Power is not given; it is taken, and often unseen. I intend to watch from the shadows while the world believes they see nothing.
