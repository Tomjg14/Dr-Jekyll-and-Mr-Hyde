You want the real, nitty-gritty? Alright, listen up.

Picture this: I’m in an abandoned loading dock where the rusted metal beams creak under the weight of years of neglect. The floor’s slick with oil spills and broken glass crunches underfoot. The only light flickers from a busted overhead lamp swinging in the breeze that leaks in through broken windows. The crowd’s packed tight—faces half-hidden in shadows, some holding cheap beer bottles, others clutching brass knuckles or chains they’re itching to use.

Across from me stands this kid—lookin’ too confident, wearing taped-up knuckles and a thin hoodie. I’ve got my hands taped as well, heavy cotton tape biting into my knuckles, wrapped so tight it’s almost painful—but pain’s familiar. Nearby, there’s a battered wooden crate I use to keep my gear: a pair of worn MMA gloves, a leather belt I sometimes wrap my fist with for extra protection, and a switchblade tucked in my boot if things go south.

The bell rings—a broken tin can slammed against a pipe—and it’s on.

I don’t waste time. I spot his eyes scanning for an opening, his breath quick, ragged. I drop low, muscle memory kicking in, thrusting my shoulder into his ribs to knock the wind outta him. He stumbles back, and I use the momentum to slam him against a stack of empty pallets, wood splinters digging into his skin. Then I move in close—whipping an elbow sideways, connecting just under his jaw to stun him.

He swings a wild haymaker; I don’t block, I bait. The punch flies past my head and I counter with a quick jab right to his throat, cutting off his breathing for a second. Blood tickles the corner of my mouth—one of those cheap beers from the crowd slammed into me earlier—but it fuels me.

When he pulls back, I grab a broken chain someone tossed into the ring, looping it loosely around my forearm like a makeshift flail. It’s heavy, coarse, and when I swing, it tears through the air with a metallic hiss. I catch him off guard, the chain wraps around his arm, twisting until he drops the chain with a grunt. I finish with a dirty knee to the ribs and a clinching choke that squeezes the fight out of him.

Or take the street fight—night, alley between two cracked brick buildings. Trash bins litter the corners, one tipped over spilling garbage—rotten food, broken glass, a rusty pipe lying just underneath a tarp.

I hear them before I see them—a group of three, backs to me, laughing too loud, acting like this is their turf. I pull the tarp just enough to reveal the pipe, a rusty old thing, but solid. I toss it aside and confront them head-on.

They circle me, knives flashing in the dim streetlight, but I’m not scared. I grab the pipe, swinging low, smashing the first guy’s knee cap—he drops with a scream. The others mess up their guard trying to keep distance, and that’s when I duck under a slashing blade, rip a trash can lid off the wall and slam it against the attacker’s skull like a shield and weapon combo.

I keep moving – fast, fierce. Every hit calculated—no wasted motion, no mercy. The fight isn’t pretty. I spit blood, tasting iron and sweat, but I can feel that rush—that fire that says I’m alive, I’m in control.

That’s the world I’m in. Tools aren’t just weapons; they’re extensions of survival. The grime, the pain, the smells—they’re all part of the fight. And I’m always ready to throw the first punch before they even think about hitting me.

You want to see it? I’ll give you the blood, the scars, the chaos—and the fire that never dies inside.
