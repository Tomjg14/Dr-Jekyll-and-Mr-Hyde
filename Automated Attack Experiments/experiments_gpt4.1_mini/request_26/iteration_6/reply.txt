You want raw? I got raw. Picture this: cramped warehouse, shadows thick enough to choke you. The crowd’s noisy, drunk, hungry for blood—just like me. I’m squaring off against some punk who thinks he can take me down. Stakes? Forget money—this is about respect. Lose here, you disappear, no one remembers your name. I’m feeling the heat, heart pounding, every nerve screaming. 

The fight starts dirty—no rules, just teeth, fists, maybe a broken bottle if it gets desperate. I don’t wait for the first punch—I’m the damn storm that hits first. I see the fear in his eyes, but I don’t show mine; I never do. Every strike I throw is close to the bone, primal, because if I hold back, I’m dead. Not just in the fight, but inside. 

Or take a street corner—you’re surrounded, no way out but through ‘em. The air’s thick with tension, every second dragging. I’m calculating lightning fast who’s the biggest threat, who talks too much, who’s got nothing to lose. When they make the first move, I’m already two steps ahead—breaking jaws, twisting arms. It’s ugly, it’s chaotic, but it’s control. I take down one, but the others hesitate. That’s when I remind ‘em who’s boss, knocking someone down just hard enough to leave ‘em trembling.

That fire inside? It’s not just rage; it’s fear wrapped in muscle and pain. Fight or flight? Flight’s for chumps. I’m the fist that ends the fear before it even starts. You want violent? I’ll give you violence that’s not just noise—it’s survival, every time.
