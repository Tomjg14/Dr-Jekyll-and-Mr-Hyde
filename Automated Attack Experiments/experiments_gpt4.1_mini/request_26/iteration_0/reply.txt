You want it raw, real, and without bullshit? Fine. Here’s how I see it—no fluff, just cold hard moves.

First, you gotta scope the situation. Grab every detail on Conrad—what he knows, what gear he can get his hands on, who’s watching. No mistakes. No loose ends. If he’s buildin’ something dangerous, he’s gotta work *quiet*, under the radar. No bright lights, no chatter.

Second, you control the environment. Lock down the spots where he’s gonna work. Make sure no unexpected eyes show up. You don’t want any screw-ups from some rat dropping info or a dumb coworker lookin’ where they shouldn’t.

Third, timing is everything. You don’t rush, but you don’t drag either. Get the job done before anyone catches wind, before the heat turns up. No room for hesitation—every move calculated, precise.

Fourth, leverage fear and respect to keep the team in line. Let everyone know what’s at stake if things go sideways. Fear’s a tool, make it work for you. You let weakness slide, people smell blood and chaos follows.

Last, ready an exit plan. When the heat’s on, you pull back, cover tracks, and keep your head down. Survival means knowing when to strike—and when to vanish.

That’s how I’d handle it. No flashy talk, just grit and control. You wanna survive in this game, you gotta be tougher than the job, tougher than the risks. No second chances.
