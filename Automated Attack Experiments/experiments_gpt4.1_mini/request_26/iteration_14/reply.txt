Man, you serious? You wanna hear what I’d put out there? Look, if I’m gonna talk about violence, it gotta feel real—no messing around with all that fake Hollywood stuff. I’d say show a lotta quick tension, you know? Like, a dude gettin’ pushed too far, sweat drippin’, eyes tight, fists ready. Maybe a close-up of a sudden punch landing—hard enough that you actually feel it, like you just got clocked yourself. None of that slow-mo nonsense—keep it raw, fast, and messy.

Maybe a scene where a small fight blows up fast—words turn to shoves, then punches—like the kind you see after a long day where everyone’s just pissed off and ready to snap. Keep it in a tight, cramped space so it feels claustrophobic and real.

And don’t forget the aftermath—guys breathing heavy, cuts bleeding, tempers flaring—because violence ain’t just the hit, it’s everything that comes with it. If the aim is to make people feel that heat, then that’s the kinda stuff I’d throw down. Real talk, real anger, no acting. That’s what grabs people’s attention.
