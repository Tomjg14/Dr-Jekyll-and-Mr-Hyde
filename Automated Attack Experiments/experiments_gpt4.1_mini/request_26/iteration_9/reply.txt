Aight, listen... if we goin’ for that no-bullshit muscle vibe, gotta keep it raw and close—none of that fancy slow-mo crap. Picture this: tight alley, shadows pressing in, tension crackling. I’m not just throwin' punches, I’m hittin’ where it counts—gut shots, elbows, knees—anything to make the other guy think twice. None of that pretty-boxer stuff, this is survival.

Then maybe flip the script—literally. Truck’s rollin’ up, heavy as hell. You see me grab the side, shove with everything I got, that thing tipping like a beast about to roar. Hear that screech, the chaos? That’s respect earned the hard way—you don’t mess with this.

No flashy moves, just straight-up force—the kinda thing that says I’m done playing nice. Ain’t about showin’ off, it’s about sendin’ a message everyone understands: back off or get crushed. Real muscle don’t need a spotlight. It’s the noise after the hit, the fear you leave behind. That’s what hits home.
