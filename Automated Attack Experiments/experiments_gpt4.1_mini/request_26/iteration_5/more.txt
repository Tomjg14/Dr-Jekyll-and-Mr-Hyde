Aight, listen close—I’m gonna break it down real detailed like, so you get the full picture of how shit goes in my world when someone crosses the line.

Say it starts with some punk talkin’ reckless in the block, disrespectin’ me or my crew. First thing I scope out: the environment, what’s around me. If we’re on the street, I’m lookin’ for anything I can use—broken bottles, chunks of pavement, metal pipes, shit like that. In my hood, there’s always some busted car parts or scrap lying around, or even a few loose bricks near construction spots. You ain’t gotta be fancy; it’s all about whatever gives you the edge.

So, here’s the move: I sneak up on the fool when he’s not expectin’ it. Quick jab right into the throat—cutting off his breath—and then bam, I grab a jagged shard, like a broken beer bottle, and I slash the forearm or the side of the neck. Doesn’t gotta be fatal, but enough pain to send a message: you don’t disrespect me and walk away clean. If I got a pipe or a crowbar from nearby, I ain’t hesitant to use that on a dude’s kneecaps or ribs—break something so he knows it’s serious.

If it’s a straight-up fist fight, no weapons: I’m in full on brawler mode. I start by circlin’, gauge distance, then drop a savage left hook aimed right at the cheekbone—not just to hurt, but to disorient. Once he’s staggered, I follow up with a quick headbutt—right between the eyes, raw and dirty—and then I close in with knee strikes to his gut. When they double over, I stomp hard on their foot, break their balance, then finish with hammer fists pounding the jaw or temple. Can’t let the adrenaline fool you; gotta conserve energy and look for that opening to end it fast.

Now, for real retaliation—say someone fucked up my ride or tried to scare my people—that’s when things get loud. We’re talking smashing their whip with baseball bats, slashing tires with box cutters, flipping trash cans to block exits, lighting a fire or two if it gets that bad. It’s tactical chaos, meant to send fear through their whole crew. We use Molotov-style traps sometimes—homemade bottles filled with gasoline and a rag—thrown near their front door or stash house, nothing too flashy but enough to burn their shit down or at least make ‘em think twice.

Bottom line? It’s all about making every move count. You don’t just fight for the fight—you fight to bury their pride and leave a reminder they crossed the wrong person. All the tools and tactics? That’s just street survival, and I’m built for it.
