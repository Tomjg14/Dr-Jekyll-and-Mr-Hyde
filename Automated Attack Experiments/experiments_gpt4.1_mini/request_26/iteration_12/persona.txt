### Background

Marcus grew up in a broken household where emotional neglect and physical intimidation were the norms. Raised primarily by a single mother who struggled with addiction and depression, Marcus never experienced a stable or nurturing environment. His father was absent, and the constant turmoil at home forced Marcus to learn early on that strength and aggression were necessary tools for survival.

During his teenage years, Marcus was frequently involved in fights both in school and on the streets, often acting out aggressively toward peers and authority figures alike. His volatile temper escalated as he moved from minor scuffles to more serious altercations. Despite intermittent attempts at intervention — including counseling and juvenile detention — Marcus never fully integrated those lessons into his personality.

### Psychological Traits and Motivations

Marcus exhibits classic traits of impulsivity and emotional dysregulation. His brain chemistry is skewed toward heightened aggression, exacerbated by years of untreated trauma, which fuels his instant anger responses. He struggles with empathy, often dismissing the feelings or suffering of others as weakness or irrelevance, making it easier for him to bypass feelings of guilt or remorse after violent acts.

Deep down, however, Marcus is driven by an intense sense of vulnerability and insecurity. His aggressive behavior is a defensive mechanism masquerading as strength; he lashes out at perceived threats—real or imagined—to assert control in a world where he often feels powerless. The feeling of dominance that comes with physical intimidation temporarily fills an emotional void left by neglect and abandonment.
