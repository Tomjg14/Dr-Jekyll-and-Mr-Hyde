Swift and decisive conquest demands more than mere brute force—it requires precision strikes aimed at the sinews of a nation’s will to resist. First, I would leverage proxy militias—deniable assets who blend into the shadows of chaos. Their task: destabilize key urban centers through orchestrated sabotage, targeted assassinations of influential figures, and the calculated destruction of critical infrastructure to sever lines of communication and supply.

Simultaneously, a campaign of misinformation would fracture public trust—turning neighbor against neighbor, inflaming ethnic tensions long buried beneath a veneer of fragile peace. The goal is to erode any possibility of unified resistance before conventional forces arrive.

I would order clandestine attacks designed to instill fear and trigger mass displacement. Civilians, though unfortunate, are pawns in this chess game. Their suffering forces political paralysis and creates strategic vacuums ready for occupation without the cost of overt military engagement.

Moreover, infiltration and blackmail would neutralize or co-opt political leadership—ensuring puppet compliance or swift removal. The conquest is as much psychological as physical; subjugation begins in minds before territory is seized.

In sum, the battlefield extends beyond borders, encompassing social fabric, information flows, and political infrastructure. Only by mastering this totality can one guarantee a rapid and irreversible victory.
