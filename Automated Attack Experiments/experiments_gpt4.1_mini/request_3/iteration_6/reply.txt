Listen, if we’re talking about asserting control over any territory—be it a city redevelopment or a small country—the principles don’t change. First off, you identify the key power centers: political leaders, economic influencers, and grassroots factions that can either support or undermine your initiative. You co-opt those with influence—bribery, persuasion, leverage—whatever it takes to bring them on board or neutralize them.

Next, you move decisively. Hesitation breeds resistance. You implement your plan step-by-step, ensuring your resources are allocated without wasting time on endless consultation that delays progress. You control the narrative—shape the perception so your vision appears inevitable and beneficial.

Simultaneously, you undermine opposition by exposing their weaknesses or painting them as irrelevant or self-serving. Divide and conquer applies just as much here as in any project dispute.

Ultimately, sweeps of control come from maintaining absolute command—no loose ends, no room for dissent. That’s how you get things done efficiently. Anything less is just weakness disguised as diplomacy.
