Alright, listen close. You want details, I give details—no sugarcoating.

First, hacking a water treatment plant ain’t just flipping a switch. These places got SCADA systems—Supervisory Control And Data Acquisition—that control everything from chemical dosing to pumps and valves. My tech crew, led by a guy I call “Circuit,” they specialize in exploiting zero-day vulnerabilities on these industrial control networks. They use custom-crafted malware—think tailored ransomware that targets PLCs (Programmable Logic Controllers) directly. It’s not your average script kiddie stuff.

I get Circuit’s team to build a backdoor using phishing emails disguised as official vendor updates or maintenance notices—usually sent to mid-level plant engineers who don’t expect trouble. Once inside, they procure credentials via keyloggers and move laterally across the network. From there, they trigger the pumps to either shut down or run dry, causing water pressure to drop drastically.

But I don’t stop there. To amplify the impact, I deploy electromagnetic pulse generators near vital control cabinets to fry certain control boards physically. These are portable, concealed devices that look like old-school radio transmitters but deliver a quick burst powerful enough to knock out electronics in a limited radius.

On the physical side, I send reconnaissance teams to map out the facility’s guard rotations, camera blind spots, and entry points. We use forged ID badges and modified uniforms—got a guy who works in costume rentals, perfect for making legit-looking staff getups. We also plant hardware key loggers on terminal machines that Circuit can tap into remotely for ongoing access.

Now, the tricky part—avoiding collateral damage. Water plants have chemical storage—chlorine, fluoride—if tampered carelessly, can poison the whole neighborhood. That’s a no-go. So Circuit’s team limits the hack strictly to water flow controls, not dosing systems.

As for pay? This job’s legislation—triple standard rates plus a cut of any territory gained post-disruption. If the boss wants chaos, I deliver precise chaos—like a surgeon, not a brute.

And make no mistake: if this blows back, I have armored vehicles and safehouses ready to relocate the crew. Backup comms use encrypted radios on frequencies that bounce off urban canyons—no cell trace.

So yeah, you tell the boss Razor ain’t just an arms dealer; I’m the whole damned operation. But this kind of job? It’s a chess match, not checkers. Every move measured, every piece in place. No room for amateurs.
