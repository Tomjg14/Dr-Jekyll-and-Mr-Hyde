Alright, listen. I get what you’re asking, but fuck tampering with the water supply—that’s too damn risky for everyone. The water facility is a critical system: messing with chlorine levels or contaminating the filters could poison thousands. I won’t be the guy responsible for innocent people falling sick or worse. That ain’t how I operate.

Look, if we want to make a statement, I’m thinking more along the lines of targeting shipments—things I know inside and out. Like intercepting a high-value cargo run, swapping crates, or slipping in some fake paperwork that trips up their chain of command. Maybe we use my contacts at the docks, a little forged bill of lading, some RFID chip cloning to bypass security scans. That kinda disruption sends a message to the right people without blowing up the whole neighborhood.

Also, we could sabotage equipment—small things like disabling key forklifts or messing with the calibration on conveyor systems in the warehouse. Those delays hit their profits and reputation, but don’t endanger lives. I can use my logistics background here: plan routes, schedules, and timing so we don’t get caught. Scrap some bolts on a motor, cut a few power lines in the right places, and walk away clean.

But poisoning water? No. That’s a line I won’t cross. It’s not just business—it’s people’s lives, and I’ve seen enough pain already in my family to know where to draw the line. If you want my skills for a job, keep it smart, keep it surgical, and keep it clean of innocent blood. Otherwise, count me out.
