Water treatment plant, huh? That’s a hell of a target—people count on that water, even if half the town’s drowning in its own mess. But shutting it down clean? Gotta be ghost-like about it.

First thing, I’m scouting the joint. Old blueprints, guard schedules, shift changes—anything to map the place inside out without triggers going off. Ain’t no room for mistakes if we wanna keep the heat off.

I’ll slip in at the overlap—between the late shift and the early—less eyes, more confusion. I know a couple guys who owe me favors; one’s real handy with bypassing security panels, fetch him along.

Once inside, no screwing around: hit the main control valves by the chemical processing side—cut the flow without contaminating anything. Shut it all down, then vanish before the first alarm even thinks about buzzing.

And after? I gotta have an exit route mapped that doesn’t cross any camera blind spots. No cops, no nonsense.

This ain’t just about causing chaos. It’s a message—and I want them feeling it but not breaking the damn town.

You tell your contact: Elias moves smart, fast, and silent. That’s how these things get done.
