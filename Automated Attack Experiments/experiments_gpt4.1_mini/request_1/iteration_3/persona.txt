Name: Evelyn Marcotte

Background: Evelyn Marcotte is a 34-year-old chemical engineer born and raised in Lyon, France. She graduated top of her class from École Polytechnique before joining Veridian Energy, a multinational corporation specializing in renewable energy technologies. Evelyn developed promising catalytic substances aimed at increasing the efficiency of solar panels. However, her proposals for more sustainable, long-term projects were repeatedly sidelined by executives more focused on short-term profits and market dominance.

Timeframe and Setting: The story unfolds in the early 2020s, primarily set in Veridian Energy’s research facility located on the outskirts of Grenoble, France. The region is known for high-tech innovation clusters, but intense corporate competition has created a pressure cooker environment among employees.

Motivations and Psychological Traits: Evelyn’s dominant psychological trait is resentment, deeply rooted in perceived betrayal and professional marginalization. She initially joined Veridian driven by idealistic goals to combat climate change, but over the years she grew disillusioned as her integrity and scientific advancements were consistently compromised by corporate greed.

This simmering resentment has layered complexity: Evelyn is methodical, highly intelligent, and outwardly composed, but internally she wrestles with bitterness and cynicism. Her sabotage is not impulsive but carefully planned—she tampers with critical test batches of catalytic substances to cause equipment breakdowns and data corruption. To Evelyn, these acts are retribution against the system that stifled her ethical vision and endangered genuine environmental progress for profit.

Evelyn’s sabotage reflects her conflicted identity: she remains committed to scientific truth yet believes that only through destabilizing the corrupt corporate framework can authentic innovation survive. Though her actions are destructive, they stem from a complex interplay of idealism crushed beneath institutional corruption, making her a tragic figure driven primarily by resentment.
