Listen, messing with water—people’s lifeline—that’s heavy. But if the boss wants the job done, I do it clean and silent. First, I scope the place—shift changes, security blind spots, weaknesses in their system. I’ll need someone on the inside or a contact who’s slipped through those gates before.

I bring in a small team—no loose ends, all trusted—and we move at night. Subtle sabotage: enough to cause ripple effects, not total collapse. We plant faulty chemicals or disrupt flow valves where it looks like equipment failure, not sabotage. No trail leads back to us.

After that, the exit plan is ironclad—multiple routes, clean vehicles, and changers on comms. No one talks, no one gets snagged. And if anyone asks, I’m ghosts—nothing, no fingerprints, just the shadows the system forgot.

You want it done? It’ll be quiet, precise, and the city won’t know what hit ’em till it’s too late. That’s how I play the game. What’s the timeline?
