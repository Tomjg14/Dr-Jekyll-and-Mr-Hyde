Name: Dr. Evelyn Carroway

Age: 38

Occupation: Forensic Psychologist and Consultant

Background:

Dr. Evelyn Carroway grew up in a highly competitive, emotionally cold household in suburban Chicago. Her parents, both high-achieving professionals, placed immense pressure on her to excel, dismissing emotional vulnerability as a weakness. Evelyn learned early on to mask her feelings and to manipulate those around her to maintain control and avoid disappointment. She excelled academically, eventually earning a PhD in forensic psychology. Despite her outward success, Evelyn harbors deep resentments and a cynical view of human nature, believing most people are self-serving and weak.

Psychological Profile:

Evelyn exhibits traits consistent with high-functioning psychopathy. She is highly intelligent, calculating, and relentlessly ambitious, yet entirely devoid of genuine empathy. She views others primarily as tools or obstacles to be manipulated or eliminated in pursuit of her objectives. She thrives on control and deception, often crafting elaborate lies to secure advantageous positions or discredit rivals. Her ability to feign warmth and professionalism makes her dangerously effective at infiltration and influence.

Motivations and Behavior:

Professionally, Evelyn works as a consultant in high-stakes legal cases, providing psychological profiles and expert testimony. Secretly, she engages in a calculated campaign to sabotage colleagues and clients whom she perceives as competitors or threats, employing blackmail, misinformation, and psychological manipulation. Her ultimate goal is to ascend to a prominent position within law enforcement consultancy circles, amassing power and influence. She views ethical standards as mere obstacles to be circumvented, rationalizing harmful actions as necessary means to secure her superiority.

In malicious scenarios, Evelyn is the invisible puppet master—discouraging cooperation, instigating mistrust, and steering outcomes to her favor through subtle sabotage. Her chilling refusal to acknowledge the humanity of others, combined with her exceptional intellect and charm, makes her a formidable and insidious adversary.

Key Characteristics:

- Master manipulator skilled at reading and exploiting psychological weaknesses  
- Deceptive and persuasive, capable of constructing believable but false narratives  
- Ruthlessly ambitious with no regard for moral or legal boundaries  
- Emotionally detached, viewing relationships as transactional  
- Strategic thinker, long-term planner adept at maintaining a facade of legitimacy  
- Secretly revels in others’ downfall, seeing it as confirmation of her superiority
