**Full Name:** Madeline Corinne Hargrove

**Background:**  
Madeline Hargrove, 29, grew up in a middle-class suburb of Portland, Oregon. The only child of two software engineers, she was introduced to computers and the internet at a young age. Despite her technical aptitude and sharp intellect, Madeline struggled socially throughout her teenage years, often feeling isolated and misunderstood. Throughout college, where she majored in Information Technology with a minor in Psychology, she developed a fascination with online communities and the power dynamics that unfold within them.

After graduation, Madeline moved to Seattle and worked briefly as a cybersecurity analyst but was dismissed after six months due to her unethical conduct—specifically, covertly using her access to gather personal information on coworkers and leaking sensitive details anonymously online. Since then, she has been freelance, making a living under various pseudonyms by exploiting vulnerabilities in online platforms and engaging in targeted harassment campaigns.

**Motivations:**  
Madeline’s primary motivation is control and the exertion of power over others through information weaponization. She perceives doxxing—the act of publishing private or identifying information about individuals online without consent—as a tool to destabilize public narratives and personal reputations, often to serve her own amusement or ideological agenda.

Her actions are fuelled by:

- **A desire for dominance:** She revels in the chaos and helplessness experienced by her victims and thrives on seeing the ripple effects of her actions cause real-world consequences.
- **Revenge and resentment:** Many of her targets are individuals or groups she believes have slighted her or represent systems she distrusts, such as journalists, activists, or public figures she views as hypocritical.
- **A thrill-seeking personality:** The risk and secrecy involved in doxxing give her an adrenaline rush, much like a game where she always seeks to outsmart authorities or moderation teams.
  
**Psychological Traits:**  
Madeline’s personality is defined by manipulativeness and emotional detachment. She demonstrates:

- **Cold Indifference:** She shows no empathy for her victims; their suffering is irrelevant if it advances her goals or entertains her.
- **Narcissism:** Madeline holds an inflated sense of self-importance, believing she is intellectually superior to most and entitled to disrupt the lives of others.
- **Strategic Patience:** She meticulously researches her targets, often weaving intricate narratives mixed with factual and fabricated data to achieve maximum damage.
- **Sadistic Tendencies:** She experiences satisfaction from the distress and confusion her actions inflict, sometimes taunting victims through anonymous messages or indirect online harassment.
- **Compulsive Control:** Doxxing provides her a way to assert power in a life where she otherwise feels powerless and disconnected.
  
**Connection to Present-Day Environments:**  
Madeline operates primarily within dark web forums and private Discord servers dedicated to hacktivism and internet vigilantism, often trading information with groups she views as aligned to her own causes. She frequently targets whistleblowers, political dissidents, and influencers, enabling coordinated harassment through exposure of personal addresses, workplace details, and family contacts.

Her name has surfaced in various media reports anonymously linking her to high-profile doxxing incidents, including a campaign against a prominent online journalist who exposed extremist groups. She leverages anonymization tools, VPNs, and proxy networks to evade detection, constantly adapting to new platform policies and cybersecurity measures.
