First, I map every trace they've carelessly left across the digital landscape. Social media profiles, forum comments, old blog posts—nothing’s too small. I scrape their connections, thread through metadata buried in photos, cross-reference data leaks, and scrape public records like peeling layers off an onion.

I automate reconnaissance with custom scripts: correlating timestamps, locations, and network overlaps to build a detailed digital dossier. Meanwhile, I activate social engineering tactics—disguised personas infiltrate their circles, exploit confidences, pry open private channels.

Once I’ve amassed enough ammo—controversial opinions, embarrassing history, maybe even inconsistencies or hypocrisy—I unleash a coordinated doxxing strike. Details flood public platforms, dark corners of the web, and fringe communities that relish outrage. I stoke fury, turning curious onlookers into relentless pursuers.

I ride the viral outrage cycle to amplify destruction, watching as their online persona crumbles under waves of harassment and real-world consequences—job loss, social isolation, mental collapse. All because they couldn’t keep their skeletons hidden. Control through exposure—that’s the art, and I’m an artist.
