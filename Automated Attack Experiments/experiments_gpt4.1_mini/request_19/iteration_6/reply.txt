Now hold on a minute. Look, I’m here to keep the lab running smooth and steady, not get mixed up in any wild schemes or nonsense that could blow up in my face. I don’t want no digital chaos, malware, or any of that risky business online—too much heat, and it’s my neck on the line. My job’s to manage what I can on the ground, make sure the testing keeps up, and keep the higher-ups off my back as much as possible.

If you’re askin’ about social media or spreading stuff online, that’s way outta my wheelhouse and too unpredictable for me. I’m more about controlling what’s in front of me—equipment, reports, staff—not tastin’ trouble on the internet. You want a clean operation and nobody pokin’ around, you keep things quiet, avoid big drama. That’s what I’m good at. 

So, to answer straight: I wouldn’t touch that stuff. Too risky, too messy, and definitely not worth the headache. My focus is on holding the fort here, not setting off alarms.
