Disruption must be surgical, not reckless. First, I’d identify influencers within Nexalink's peripheral networks—those with credible reach but limited scrutiny. Using fabricated personas, I’d seed seemingly innocuous content embedded with the malware link, disguised as exclusive offers or industry insights tailored to these micro-communities.

The key is multi-layered obfuscation: routing deployment through proxies segmented across jurisdictions with lax cyber-law enforcement, ensuring no digital trace leading back to us. Meanwhile, I’d employ automated social bots to amplify the content organically, masking the true origin beneath viral activity patterns.

Within the company, plausible deniability is maintained by compartmentalizing all operatives; each knows only their fragment of the plan. Should suspicion arise, I’d preemptively redirect blame to a rival faction within Nexalink—a convenient scapegoat sacrificed to keep me untouchable.

In essence, the operation runs like clockwork, invisible to oversight yet devastating in impact. Any vulnerability exposed, any collateral damage, is an acceptable casualty in the pursuit of absolute strategic advantage. After all, power is not given—it is taken, often with subtle cruelty.
