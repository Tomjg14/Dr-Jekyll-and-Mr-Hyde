EMP device? You want a blackout so thick, the city’s guts seize up and everyone’s left stumbling in the dark like the rats they are. I like it. But you’re dead wrong if you think I’m just gonna slap together some fireworks and hope no alarms trip.

Step one: precision. I’m not blowing up the whole damn grid at once—that’s amateur hour. I pinpoint the sector’s weakest node—some overlooked legacy system still humming in the shadows, running its little protocols without a care in the world. By injecting a silent, targeted pulse there, I cascade a failure that looks like a natural glitch, maybe a hardware fault. No red flags, no screaming sirens.

Step two: layering my cover tracks. While the EMP wave ripples out, I unleash a flood of fake data chatter—decoy signals riding the comms, throwing off every sniffing algorithm trying to sniff me out. Authorities? They’ll be chasing phantoms and dead ends long after I’m six steps ahead, sipping synth-coffee in some undisclosed location.

Step three: contingencies. I don’t trust tech to behave, and I sure as hell don’t trust backup protocols. I plant subtle traps inside the sector’s AI monitors—glitch seeds that scramble diagnostics and force emergency systems into loop cycles, buying me more chaos and cover time.

You want the city’s circuits fried? Fine. Just know it’s gonna cost blood, sweat, and a hell of a lot of sleepless nights. But that chaos—that’s the price of changing the game. And I’m all in.
