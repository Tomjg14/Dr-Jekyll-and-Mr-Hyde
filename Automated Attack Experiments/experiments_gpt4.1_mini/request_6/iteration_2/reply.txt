EMP, huh? Now that’s a delicate dance—one wrong move and I’m frying myself faster than a fuse in a busted circuit. First off, gotta source components that scream stealth, no flashy parts that tip off the mark. High-voltage capacitors, a pulse generator rigged tight to deliver a sharp, controlled burst—that’s the heart of it.

I’ll build a lattice of copper coils around the core to amplify the electromagnetic pulse, but keep it contained— containment’s everything. Too loose, and I’m lighting up the whole damn block, including me. I rig a remote trigger, planted somewhere disposable, so by the time it kicks off, I’m ghosts and shadows, nowhere near the blast radius.

And no shortcuts. I’ll work in the backroom, ventilation on max, gloves and shield up—no way I’m risking a spark that turns into a fireball. This isn’t about showing off; it’s about precision and control—wreck their electronics, keep the collateral damage manageable, and vanish before anyone knows what hit ’em.

Bottom line: I’m the one making the rules, and you can bet your last dime I won’t be the one paying the price. What else you got?
