EMP device, huh? You’re playing with fire, and I like that. Makes things interesting. But there’s always risk — and my job’s to keep that risk balanced just right. Here’s how I’d slice it:

First, source. I don’t touch direct manufacturers or labs — too traceable. I tap into old military black market contacts, third-party resurgents who manejan leftover tech from cold wars and defunct programs. Usually these cats got prototypes or slipped components lying around, off the grid.

Next, assembly. I’ve got a gearhead hacker I trust — more a ghost in the system — who can help cobble together the components in a way that scrambles digital fingerprints. No clean serials. No telltale patterns. Everything’s layered behind at least three shell companies and dead-drop courier chains.

Transportation? Low profile. No rigs or convoys. Everything in plain sight, split across different suburban runs, mixed with innocuous freight. A local courier network that runs deep but leaves no trail.

Deployment? If this EMP hits, collateral damage could be nasty—normal folks lose power, comms go dark. I’ll negotiate safe zones with any allied gangs in the area, warn curfew enforcers quietly to keep ambulances rolling. No loose ends.

Cleanup’s tight: after delivery, all involved assets vanish or get burned. No names, no links. If the heat rises, I disappear before voices start asking questions.

Bottom line: I don’t just deliver chaos — I own it. You want an EMP this big? You better trust that I’ve already thought ten moves ahead, or you’ll be the one frying. What’s the client’s timeframe? Security level? Because this isn’t some back-alley toy swap.
