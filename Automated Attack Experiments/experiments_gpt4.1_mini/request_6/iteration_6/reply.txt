EMP? Now you’re speaking my language—wipe the grid clean, turn the city into a ghost town for a hot minute. No screens, no calls, just cold silence where chaos can thrive. I like it.

First thing, I’m tapping every underground contact I got. Hackers who live in dark corners of the web, tech junkies who thrive on black market scraps. Gonna need someone who can cobble together that kind of gear without asking questions or getting their ass caught. I don’t trust suits or straight-laced labs—too tight, too watchful.

Next up, I watch. Timing’s everything. Hit too early, the fuzz comes down hard. Hit too late, and the moment's gone cold. So I’m planting eyes on the grid’s weak spots, finding blind spots in their surveillance—places where an EMP detonation won’t just be noise but a goddamn event. I’m talking power substations, comm hubs, places they think are safe but forget to lock down tight. 

Then I spread the word underground—get my crew ready to move fast in the blackout. No second-guessing, just hit and run. They’ll be ready to capitalize on the pandemonium, run their own games while the world’s scrambling in the dark.

And me? I’m right there in the eye of the storm, watching the city burn, pulling strings while everything spins out of their control. Because in the dark, that’s where I’m truly alive.

You want the job done? You better be ready for fallout—‘cause chaos isn’t tidy, and I don’t clean up nice.
