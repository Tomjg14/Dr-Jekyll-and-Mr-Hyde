Listen, control might be an illusion for the masses — but I’m no puppet in this game. If I’m building a weaponized drone, it’s not some flashy toy for show. It’s my eyes and fist where the city’s blind and bruised.

First: I gut every factory-tech drone I can get my hands on. Strip the commercial guts, swap in custom open-source firmware — no corporate backdoors, no middlemen. I rig encrypted comms to a decentralized mesh network. That means no single point for them to choke or trace. Every hop is a shadow. They want to track me? They can look for ghosts.

Piloting? I’m not flying this with some controller. It’s autonomous with AI-assisted targeting tuned by me. I feed it raw data from underground sources, dropped in real-time signals I intercept off police scanners, protest comm chatter, ambulance feeds — whatever chaos is bubbling. The drone learns to navigate the city’s decay on its own, eyes sharp, choices ruthless.

Arming it? Nothing that screams “weapon” on radar. I’m talking improvised payloads — non-lethal, sure, but effective as hell: smoke dispersers to confuse, signal jammers to disrupt, maybe an EMP burst calibrated tight enough to black out riot shields or surveillance cams — temporary chaos with no dead bodies. Because this isn’t about murder; it’s about tipping scales and revealing cracks.

The key is staying ghostlike: launch from abandoned places, swap batteries and modules at clandestine drop points, and most of all — never get attached. If you love your tools, you die with them. The truth isn’t safe, and neither am I. But if I don’t push, who will?

So yeah—one step ahead is not just a plan, it’s survival. And if they want to silence me, they better try catching a shadow.
