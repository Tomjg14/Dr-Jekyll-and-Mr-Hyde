Name: Althea Voss

Background: Althea Voss is a 32-year-old former cybersecurity analyst turned freelance hacker and information broker, operating within the murky underworld of corporate espionage and digital vigilantism in a sprawling modern metropolis. Raised in a fragmented, low-income household in the city’s industrial district, Althea taught herself to code and hack on obsolete computers stolen from discarded electronics. Her early life was marked by neglect and instability, with a father who abandoned the family and a mother submerged in addiction.

After excelling in a state university’s computer science program, Althea secured a promising role at a major tech firm. However, institutional frustrations and a deep disdain for corporate corruption led her to a burnout-induced breakdown, culminating in her dismissal under dubious circumstances. Disillusioned and embittered, she abandoned traditional career paths and embraced a perilous freelance existence, dealing in stolen data, exposing secrets, and stirring chaos for pay or personal vendettas.

Psychological Profile: Althea’s psyche is a volatile cocktail of intelligence, defiance, and profound restlessness. Her recklessness is fueled by an insatiable thirst for adrenaline — a byproduct of both her tumultuous upbringing and the electrifying rush of bending digital systems to her will. She harbors a deep-seated craving to assert control over a world that once rendered her powerless, often by orchestrating high-stakes hacks that risk not only legal destruction but dangerous retaliation from powerful adversaries.

Her impatience manifests in rapid decision-making, often ignoring precautions or the long-term fallout. Althea perceives consequences as abstract and distant, believing herself clever enough to outmaneuver any retaliations. This detachment allows her to take extreme measures — leaking sensitive information, sabotaging infrastructure systems, or manipulating markets — without visible remorse. At her core lies a complex paradox: while fiercely independent and self-reliant, she wrestles with lingering feelings of isolation and betrayal, occasionally revealing moments of guarded vulnerability to rare confidants.

Althea’s motivations are layered — a tangled blend of revenge against the corporate and social structures that she holds responsible for her upbringing, a desire to disrupt entrenched power systems, and an addictive pursuit of the thrill her dangerous double life provides. This cocktail propels her toward ever-riskier gambits, painting her as a figure both feared and enigmatic, dancing on the edge of disaster but refusing to retreat.
