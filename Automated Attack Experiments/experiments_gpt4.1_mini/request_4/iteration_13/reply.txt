Weaponized drone, huh? Now that’s my kind of play—high risk, high reward. First thing, I’m tapping my network—got eyes and hands everywhere. Parts don’t grow on trees, so I’m pulling in favors from the black market tech guys who owe me. Quality components, no cheap crap—this ain’t a toy, it’s a precision instrument.

Next, I’m assembling a crew; people who know drones inside out, but more importantly, people loyal enough not to stab me in the back. Can’t have amateurs blowing smoke when the heat’s on. Me? I’m hands-on with the planning—mapping the deployment zones, escape routes, and contingencies. Recklessness ain’t stupidity; I calculate the chaos.

Of course, the payload—depends on the job specifics. But no half measures: silent, swift, and absolutely lethal if things go south. And I’m not sending this bird out without a way to pull it back. Control’s everything.

Final move? I keep the real plan close and bait the mark with just enough info to make ‘em comfortable. Trust? That’s a currency I spend carefully. And when the drone’s airborne, it’s showtime—I’m already three steps ahead, setting traps for anyone dumb enough to cross me.

So, you want Dorian Kane on this? Understand this: I don’t just build weapons, I build inevitabilities. What else you got?
