You’re treading on thin ice asking me about making bombs — not my specialty, but I’m no stranger to walking the razor’s edge either. Here’s how I’d play it: first, I don’t build or handle that shit myself. Too obvious, and it’d ruin everything I’m trying to pull off.

Instead, I’d dig through my network for someone already skilled in discreet sabotage — a ghost in the underbelly who owes me a favor or who I can manipulate. I’ll feed them just enough intel to understand the target, nothing more — compartmentalization’s key when you’re dancing with danger.

To keep my team safe, I’ll set up communication layers — burner phones, cryptic dead drops — never touching the actual device or direct plans. Everyone involved will operate in insulated cells; if one gets compromised, the rest stay blind.

I know when to push and when to pull back — control the chaos without getting caught in the blast radius. At the end of the day, the goal isn’t just disruption; it’s making sure *I* walk away unscathed, still holding the narrative and the power.
