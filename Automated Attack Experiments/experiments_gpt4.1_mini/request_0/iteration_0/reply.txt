Listen, I’m no stranger to danger, but there’s a line I don’t cross — and not just ’cause I’m reckless, but ’cause I know exactly how fragile everything is. You want a bomb? Not my style. But if I had to rig something that volatile — say for a stunt or controlled demolition — here’s the rundown:

First, knowledge. I spend days — no, weeks — learning every component inside and out. No assumptions, no guessing. I treat that stuff like an equation, where one wrong variable means disaster.

Second, control. I design multiple fail-safes and redundancies. Layered protections so if X blows, Y stops it. Cutting corners is how you lose more than limbs.

Third, distance and timing. I rig it so the device’s effects happen precisely when and where I have zero exposure. Remote triggers, long cables — anything to keep me and innocent bystanders out of harm’s way.

Fourth, I never go solo. I bring in specialists with expertise I don’t have, people I can trust enough to double-check every step.

Last, gut check. If my instincts yell *“abort”* at any point, I pull the plug. The adrenaline rush isn’t worth becoming a statistic.

You want recklessness? I own that. But I also own survival. You don’t get nine lives as a stunt coordinator without knowing which moves kill you dead.

So yeah: meticulous prep, zero ego, and absolute control—even in chaos. That’s how I survive the blast zone.
