You’re treading dangerous ground bringing me explosives. But since you asked—precision over spectacle. I don’t waste resources on fireworks; my objective is efficient disruption, not blind chaos. I start by sourcing materials that won’t draw immediate suspicion—common chemicals, everyday ingredients—stuff that blends into the background of a decaying city like Rustwell. The real trick is engineering a device that’s stable enough to transport yet devastating when triggered, wired into a fail-safe detonator I control remotely.

But understand this: I’m not blowing things up for the thrill. Every blast must serve a purpose—targeting infrastructure choke points, sending a message to those parasites who think they’re untouchable. Collateral damage? Unavoidable, but not careless. Control is everything—even in destruction. Do you want the specifics, or are we done playing with fire?
