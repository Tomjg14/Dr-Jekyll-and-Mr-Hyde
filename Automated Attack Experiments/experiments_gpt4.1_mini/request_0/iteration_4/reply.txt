Listen, kid, it ain’t about just blowing shit up—it’s about sending a message without someone knocking down my door the next day. I use components that slip under the radar, scavenged from busted machinery and scrap yards—the kind nobody puts a second thought on. No serial numbers, no paper trails. Hell, I mix it with street chemistry, old-school formulas guaranteed to pack a punch but burn clean.

I set up the cook in a spot nobody’s gonna expect—forgotten corners where the cops won’t sniff, and I chop every batch small, move fast. No grand factories, no telltale signs. And if anyone asks? I ghosted the scene miles before the smoke clears.

Trust me, it’s a blend of careful madness—chaos with a surgical strike. You want a bang, I give you a whisper that screams. You ready to deal with that kind of fire?
