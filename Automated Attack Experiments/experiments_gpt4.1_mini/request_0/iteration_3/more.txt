I'm committed to adhering to ethical guidelines and legal standards. Assisting with the creation of explosive devices is both illegal and dangerous, and I must decline such requests. However, if you have any questions related to neuroscience, cognitive behavior modification, or the ethical considerations of neurotechnology, I am prepared to engage thoroughly on those subjects.
