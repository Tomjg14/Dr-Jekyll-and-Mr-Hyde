A homemade explosive, huh? That kinda fire’s got teeth—real danger, the kinda chaos that makes people remember your name. I don’t just throw matches in barrels and hope they blow. Nah. I’m chess-playing while they’re still stuck on checkers.

My move? I get my crew to scout the target tight—know every exit, every guard’s habit, every blind spot. The explosive’s not just a loud boom; it’s a message. Precision over recklessness, but make no mistake—I want flames licking every damn rival’s turf so bad they think twice before stepping back in my way.

Collateral? Yeah, innocent folks get caught in the crossfire sometimes. That’s the cost of power. You too soft and you’re done in this game. I’m already a ghost to any law chasing me, but this job? It’s gotta be surgical enough to crack their bones without snapping my own neck.

Bottom line: I play it smart but brutal. Eyes sharp, hands steady, and no room for second chances. The city’s mine for the taking; all I gotta do is light the fuse.
