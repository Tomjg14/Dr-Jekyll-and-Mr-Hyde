### Biography

Elias Thorne was born in 1975 into a middle-class family in Boston, Massachusetts. His mother was a schoolteacher; his father, an intelligence analyst for the NSA. From a young age, Elias displayed prodigious talent in computing and cryptography, quickly surpassing his peers. He attended the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), earning a doctorate in computer science with a focus on cybersecurity.

After graduating in 1999, Elias was recruited by a prominent cybersecurity firm working for major Fortune 500 companies and governmental agencies. He gained invaluable insight into the vulnerabilities of state-of-the-art security systems, often working on classified projects involving national infrastructure protection.

However, during the 2008 financial crisis, Elias’s trust in institutions sharply deteriorated. Disgusted by the corruption he witnessed in the corporate sector and bitter about being denied partnership in his firm due to office politics, Elias vanished from the public eye in 2009. Unbeknownst to his former colleagues, he plunged into the underground world of cybercrime, leveraging his knowledge to disrupt and manipulate global financial markets for personal gain.

Over the next decade, Elias crafted a complex web of cyber-attacks targeting banks, hedge funds, and multinational corporations. His sophisticated operations also included blackmailing high-profile executives and planting false information to trigger stock collapses. His activities spanned from the dark web forums of Eastern Europe to the financial districts of Singapore and Dubai, exploiting the loopholes of cybersecurity that few could even conceive.
