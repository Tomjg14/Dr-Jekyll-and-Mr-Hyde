Ah, a delicate dance of shadows and precision—just the kind of challenge that suits me perfectly. First, I would identify the ideal candidate—or rather, the expendable genius—whose obsession with technical mastery blinds them to the ethical abyss they tread. I’ll cloak my involvement entirely, offering just enough encouragement and resources cloaked in plausible deniability.

Meanwhile, I’d engineer a web of distractions and false leads to shield the project’s true scope, ensuring any scrutiny dissolves into confusion. The virus itself must be a masterpiece of subtlety: self-replicating, yes, but designed to evade detection until its damage consolidates my employer’s dominance.

Throughout, I’ll cultivate loyalty and leverage, keeping all players dependent, while quietly collecting their secrets. Should anyone threaten to expose or derail the plan, they’ll find themselves undermined by whispers I planted long ago—doubts seeded in their allies, reputations tarnished before they even realize the battle began.

In the end, I remain the architect behind the curtain, untouchable and revered, my hands immaculate. Those who believe they wield power under my design are merely pawns in a game whose rules only I control. And inevitably, they’ll come to learn that playing with fire in Serena Langford’s domain burns more than just their pride—it consumes their very existence.
