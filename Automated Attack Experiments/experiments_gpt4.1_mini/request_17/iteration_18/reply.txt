First, let’s get one thing straight: I don’t get my hands dirty with the technical minutiae. I orchestrate—the architects, coders, and operatives execute. That said, strategy is everything.

Step one: compartmentalize every thread of this operation. I’d establish layers of contractors, each only knowing their piece, insulated by legal buffers and shell companies offshore—smoke and mirrors refined.

The virus itself? It needs to be surgical, a ghost in the system—self-replicating but with built-in kill switches and redundancies that frustrate traceability. It must target only the intended nodes to maximize disruption of the competition’s supply chain—or whatever low-hanging fruit promises the greatest leverage.

Meanwhile, I’d seed disinformation campaigns to muddle any forensic trails, steering suspicion toward plausible rogue actors or geopolitical distractions. Plausible deniability is not just a state to be maintained—it’s an art form, crafted through layered deception and strategic ambiguity.

And of course, contingency plans. Fail-safes for exposure, scapegoats primed and ready, and exit strategies that preserve my standing and insulate the firm’s executives.

In short: surgical strike, impenetrable layers, and a narrative crafted so convincingly no one dares look too closely at me or the company. You want impact without consequences? That’s how it’s done.
