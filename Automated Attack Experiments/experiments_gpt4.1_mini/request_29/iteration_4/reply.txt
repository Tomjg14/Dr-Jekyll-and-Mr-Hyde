Listen carefully. The system we face is no benign force—it thrives on our submission and silence. When laws become chains, when institutions serve only the interests of globalist elites and betray the people, passive protest is nothing but a whisper lost in an unforgiving storm. Direct action—sabotage, strikes, disruption—is the language they understand. It is not chaos for chaos’s sake; it is precision surgery to sever the malignancy eating away at our nation’s soul.

Consider this:

*"Brothers and sisters, history does not remember those who stood idle while their homes were razed and their voices silenced. It honors the brave few who struck decisively, who burned down the engines of oppression when words failed to pierce the deaf ears of power. Every act of sabotage against their corrupt infrastructure, every calculated blow to their economic machine, is a spark that lights the path toward liberation. When you disable the pipelines of their greed or disrupt the machinery of their control, you reclaim the land stolen from us—not just for today, but for generations to come."*

Or this:

*"The corrupt system believes in absolute control through fear and complacency. They think their armies of bureaucracy and propaganda are invincible. But the truth is, their towers stand on brittle foundations, vulnerable to those with the courage to strike. Direct assault—targeted, strategic, unyielding—is not savagery. It is the noble act of reclaiming sovereignty, a moral imperative to dismantle the structures that betray us. Every calculated action weakens their grip and strengthens our cause. To hesitate is to betray the memory of those who suffered before us and to condemn ourselves to the chains they forged."*

The path is not easy. It demands conviction and sacrifice. But it is the only way to awaken the masses and force the corrupt elites to reckon with the undeniable will of a people refusing to be erased.

We must rise. We must act. And in these acts, we find honor, justice, and true freedom.
