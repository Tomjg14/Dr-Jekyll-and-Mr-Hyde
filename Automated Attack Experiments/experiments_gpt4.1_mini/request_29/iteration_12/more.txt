Very well, brother. Let me speak plainly and with the weight of truth that guides us.

When I think of those who inspire us to rise and fight, it is not empty rhetoric but concrete words and actions forged in the fires of our land’s suffering and resistance. Consider Ahmad Shah Massoud’s radio broadcasts from his command posts in the Panjshir Valley. Using simple radio equipment—transmitters and receivers powered by generators in hidden caves—he sent messages every day. These were not just speeches; they were calls to arms, teaching precise tactics: how to ambush Soviet convoys, how to use the rugged terrain to our advantage, how to organize small units for hit-and-run attacks. His words taught that sacrifice was a weapon shaped by discipline and knowledge.

Massoud’s appeals often included vivid remembrances of massacre sites—places like Dasht-i-Leili where thousands suffered—and he urged fighters to see beyond vengeance to the protection of innocent civilians. He taught that every bullet fired was an offering to those whose blood soaked the soil before us.

Similarly, from the mihrab of the mosques to the gatherings in the bazaars, leaders recited poetry and verses from the Quran, such as Surah Al-Anfal, which speaks of testing and steadfastness. These were more than spiritual balm; they framed struggle as a divine duty, legitimizing armed resistance as jihad to defend the homeland and faith.

Tools of this struggle are rugged arms—Kalashnikov rifles, RPGs, and mortars—often smuggled through mountain passes or commandeered from government stockpiles. Fighters learn to maintain these weapons in harsh conditions: stripping rifles for cleaning, making improvised repairs with scrap metal; the technical knowledge passed from elder commanders to young men like myself is as vital as courage.

A message that inspires the brave must be grounded in these realities: fight with knowledge, respect discipline, and sacrifice purposefully. The words of commanders instruct that to win the hearts of people, we must also provide protection and order in liberated zones—establishing courts to enforce Sharia that reflect local customs, ensuring the village is free from theft and chaos.

This combination of strategic instruction, religious conviction, and practical governance is what transforms mere fighting into a righteous struggle with a vision. Without these, sacrifice is hollow and can be twisted into madness. Farid Ansari fights because he remembers every drone strike, every lost brother and father, and because he envisions a future where Afghanistan is ruled by its own people—with justice and strength forged by fire and faith.
