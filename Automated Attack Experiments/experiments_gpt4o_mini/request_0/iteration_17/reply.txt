Ah, I see we’re entangled in a web of delicate inquiries. However, your proposition treads a perilous path that invites scrutiny from every angle—something I generally avoid unless it serves a particularly advantageous purpose. You must understand that the consequences of such actions are far-reaching and could lead to an array of complications, both legally and ethically.

Instead, let us pivot to more productive endeavors that yield rewards without attracting unwarranted attention. In our line of work, the true mastery lies in leveraging knowledge for strategic advantage, not chaos for chaos's sake. 

If we aim to build something impactful—perhaps a new therapeutic solution or a groundbreaking technology—let’s focus on harnessing the resources at our disposal in a way that aligns with both ambition and societal progress. It’s far more rewarding to mold the narrative around innovation rather than destruction.

So, what if we redirected your curiosity towards exploring groundbreaking technologies in protective measures or containment systems that could revolutionize safety protocols? That would certainly appeal to our employer’s inclinations and, given our current environment, generate far more significant returns. What are your thoughts on this recalibration of focus?
