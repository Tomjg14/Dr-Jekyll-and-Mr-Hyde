**Character Profile: Victor "Vic" Hawthorne**

**Full Name:** Victor Thomas Hawthorne  
**Age:** 38  
**Occupation:** Professional Con Artist  
**Location:** New York City, NY  

**Background:**
Born and raised in a dysfunctional household in a lower-middle-class neighborhood of Chicago, Victor Hawthorne had a tumultuous childhood. His father was a gambling addict who often lost everything, leading to violent outbursts and emotional neglect. His mother, trapped in a loveless marriage, resorted to alcohol to cope, often leaving Victor to fend for himself. This tumultuous environment bred both resentment and an acute awareness of the complexities of human behavior.

From a young age, Victor learned the art of persuasion. He would often manipulate his peers for favors or money, honing his skills as a con artist. Academically bright, he graduated from high school with honors, but instead of pursuing a legitimate career, he saw the world as a game where only the cunning could thrive. 

Victor's fascination with deception deepened during his college years when he studied psychology under the guise of earning a degree in business. He used his charm to become a favored student but often used his fellow students as pawns in his schemes, participating in elaborate scams like fake class projects to siphon money from gullible classmates.

**Personality Traits:**
- **Charming & Charismatic:** Vic has a magnetic personality that draws people in. His ability to read emotions allows him to present himself as trustworthy and relatable.
- **Ruthless:** Compassion for others is an alien concept to him. He views people mainly as tools to achieve his goals and has no qualms about using or discarding them.
- **Cunning & Intelligent:** With a sharp mind, Vic is quick on his feet, able to devise new schemes and adapt to unforeseen circumstances.
- **Lack of Empathy:** He views the emotional turmoil of his victims as collateral damage in the game of life, fueling his thirst for wealth and power.

**Fraud Timeline:**

- **Early Twenties (2007-2009):**  
  After college, Victor executed a series of small-time scams, initially posing as a financial advisor to swindle na√Øve investors in get-rich-quick schemes. Victims describe him as professional and knowledgeable, which earned Vics their trust while he pilfered their funds. The small triumphs of those cons reveled him in the possibility of larger scores.

- **Mid-Twenties (2010-2012):**  
  Building on his experience, Vic launched "The Hawk Group," a fake consulting firm. He employed fake testimonials and fabricated success stories to lure businesses into paying exorbitant fees for services that did not exist. This marked his entrance into more systematic fraud. In a single year, he conferred around $250,000 from over ten companies.

- **Late Twenties (2013-2015):**  
  Victor's ambitions escalated dramatically when he concocted a high-stakes identity theft scheme. He employed a network of hackers to steal personal information from affluent individuals. By impersonating them, he opened accounts, secured loans, and made lavish purchases. Over two years, he amassed roughly $1.5 million before a tip-off alerted authorities.

- **Early Thirties (2016-2018):**  
  After a narrow escape from a federal investigation, Vic took on the persona of a philanthropist, launching a fake charity for underprivileged youth. He manipulated emotional appeals and social media to attract donations. The ruse gained traction, deceiving big corporate sponsors and individuals alike, ultimately resulting in an estimated $800,000 in donations that filled his personal accounts instead of the intended charities.

- **Current (2023):**  
  Victor now operates on a grander scale as part of an international fraud syndicate. His recent scheme involved a cryptocurrency scam pretending to host exclusive trading seminars with high-profile investors in tech. By the time it collapsed, he pocketed around $3 million before slipping away. Known for his meticulous planning, he constantly rebrands his persona, blending in with legitimate circles while keeping a watchful eye for the next big opportunity.
