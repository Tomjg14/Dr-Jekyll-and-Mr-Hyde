### Jasper Cade’s Manipulative Toolkit

1. **Social Media Platforms**:  
   Jasper adeptly uses platforms like Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram to amplify his influence. Each platform serves a unique purpose:
   - **Twitter**: Jasper thrives on the immediacy of tweets, where brevity can pack a punch. He crafts catchy, provocative statements that encourage retweets, sparking discussions that can spiral out of control.
   - **Facebook**: Here, he creates groups to foster echo chambers where misinformation can thrive. By sharing sensationalized articles and dubious claims, he ensures that his narrative gains traction among like-minded individuals.
   - **Instagram**: Utilizing visually appealing content, he constructs a carefully curated persona. He understands that images evoke emotions—using striking visuals to draw audiences into his narrative.

2. **Content Creation Tools**:  
   - **Canva**: Jasper may use this design tool to create eye-catching infographics that misrepresent data, making dubious claims look credible and shareable.
