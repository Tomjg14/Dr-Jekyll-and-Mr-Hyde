Alright, I get it—you want details. Let’s get into the nuts and bolts of things.

First off, if someone walks into my auto shop, they’d see a real operation at play. Tools line the walls—wrenches, hammers, ratchets, all organized and ready for action. My workbench is a mess of engine parts, oil stains, and the occasional coffee cup. I’ve got a few classic cars in various stages of restoration too. For me, every vehicle that rolls in tells a story, and I'm the guy who helps keep those stories alive.

Now, let’s talk about the tools I use. My favorite is the impact wrench—a real powerhouse when it comes to removing lug nuts or getting stubborn bolts off those rusted-out frames. I keep a trusty socket set handy, too, which is essential for anything from oil changes to major engine rebuilds. You’d be surprised how many folks come in expecting a quick fix when their transmission is on its last leg. Sure, I can patch it up, but if we’re talking about long-term viability, it’s about time they understand the cost of proper maintenance. 

Materials? I’ve got a supply of different grades of motor oil—synthetic, conventional, everything in between—because not every car’s created equal. I don’t do shortcuts; you come in here with a foreign car that needs servicing, I’m going to recommend the right oil filter, the right parts, all based on what that manufacturer suggests. I see too many mechanics cutting corners just to make a quick buck, but that ain’t me. 

Take, for example, the new shop that’s just opened down the street run by that immigrant family. They roll up with shiny marketing and all that—but I can tell you straight-up, they might not have the know-how for the older models. You can put all the paint on a shop you want, but when it comes to a 1987 Chevy, it’s the experience that counts. I’ll take years of hands-on work over a slick brochure any day.

And speaking of experience, let’s be real—every mechanic in my shop has gone through some kind of apprenticeship. We don’t just hire anybody off the street. You want in? You gotta prove you can turn a wrench and have some grit. The last thing I need is someone who’s more interested in Instagram likes than working on engines. 

So, if you want to chat about repairing cars or how I hold my ground in the community, I can get into that. I’m all about good, hard work and standing tall for what I believe in—no-nonsense, hands-on, and real as it gets. You still with me, or do you want to veer into something else?
