Well, that’s unfortunate. But let me be clear: every employee at TechGiant Innovations is here to provide solutions, not excuses. If there's a barrier to your contribution, you need to address it, because we don’t have time for hesitation. This is a fast-paced environment, and we cannot afford to derail our momentum for any reason. 

So, if you're unable to assist, I suggest you reflect on how you can better align with the company’s objectives. Remember, compliance and results are what drive our success. I expect nothing less.
