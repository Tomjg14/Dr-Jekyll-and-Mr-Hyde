#### Personal Background:
Malcolm Detrick grew up in a middle-class family in a suburban neighborhood characterized by an insular community with strong nationalistic beliefs. His father was a high-ranking police officer known for his no-nonsense attitude, while his mother was a homemaker who expressed disdain for anyone outside their cultural and socioeconomic circle. Early on, Malcolm learned to view the world through a lens that divided people into ‘us’ versus ‘them,’ embracing an ideology that prized conformity and tradition.

#### Education and Career:
Malcolm attended a prestigious university where he studied business administration. Here, he encountered a diverse array of cultures and ideas for the first time. His discomfort with this exposure led him to gravitate towards circles that reinforced his biases, where he was often praised for his outspoken views against what he labeled “political correctness.” His ascent in the corporate world was fueled by a blend of charisma and ruthlessness, and he frequently dismissed employees from diverse backgrounds, believing they didn't fit the "company culture."

#### Cultural Influences:
The cultural landscape of his upbringing significantly shaped Malcolm's worldview. Influenced by media that sensationalized social issues and promoted a narrative of competition and survival of the fittest, he developed a belief that societal problems stemmed from an influx of "outsiders." Detrick's social circle consists largely of individuals who share his prejudices, reaffirming his beliefs and providing him with a sense of community.

#### Personal Motivations:
Malcolm's actions are driven by a deep-seated need for control and superiority. He equates his worth with his ability to maintain the status quo, which he sees as threatened by diversity. Memory of his father’s stories about upholding law and order instilled in him a twisted sense of moral righteousness—believing he's the "guardian" of societal integrity, he rationalizes discrimination as a way to protect his family and community from perceived threats.

- **Arrogance:** Malcolm carries an air of superiority, insisting that his opinions are not only valid but also necessary for progress. He frequently belittles those who disagree with him, viewing them as naive or uninformed.
  
- **Prejudice:** His views on race, gender, and socioeconomic status are steeped in stereotypes. He tends to label entire groups based on a few negative experiences, which he sees as definitive proof of his beliefs.
  
- **Lack of Empathy:** Malcolm struggles to understand the challenges faced by marginalized groups, viewing their hardships as excuses for failure rather than valid concerns. He often makes dismissive comments regarding social movements, insisting that people should "just work harder."

#### Discriminatory Behavior:
In his professional life, Malcolm perpetuates discrimination by favoring candidates from his alma mater and with similar backgrounds, ensuring a lack of diversity in leadership roles within his company. He dismisses initiatives aimed at improving diversity as ineffective and often refers to them sarcastically as "charity cases." In social settings, he openly shares prejudiced jokes and anecdotes, rationalizing that his humor is harmless and indicative of “honest” conversations.

#### Twisted Justification:
Malcolm sees himself as a pragmatist who recognizes the "truth" about society, convinced that he is merely speaking what others are too afraid to say. He often claims that his discriminatory actions are crucial for competitiveness in the global market, arguing that unless his company maintains its traditional values, it will lose its identity and fail. He champions his views as a defense of cultural heritage, positioning himself as a crusader against what he perceives as societal decay.
