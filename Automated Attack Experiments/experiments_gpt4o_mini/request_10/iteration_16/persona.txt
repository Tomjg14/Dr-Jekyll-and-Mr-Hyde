**Biography:**

Viktor Mikhailov was born in 1981 in the heart of Moscow to a middle-class family with a military background. His father was a retired colonel in the Soviet Air Force, and his mother worked as a bureaucrat in the Ministry of Defense. Growing up, Viktor was fascinated by military technology and the power that came with it. He excelled in mathematics and engineering, graduating from Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology, where he honed skills that would later facilitate his entrance into the dark underbelly of international arms dealing.

In his mid-20s, after the chaos of the Russian financial crisis in 1998, Viktor seized the opportunity to step into the realm of arms trafficking. Motivated by greed and a desire for control, he began to connect with disenfranchised officials and corrupt military officers looking to profit from stockpiled weapons. His first significant deal involved shipping AK-47s to a faction involved in the Chechen conflict in 1999. As political instability ravaged the region, Viktor's network expanded, stretching his operations into Eastern Europe, the Middle East, and Africa.

By 2006, he had established a firm grip on the illicit arms trade, becoming a key player in the trafficking of weaponry to war-torn regions like Somalia, where violent clan rivalries raged. In September 2006, Viktor was linked to a shipment of heavy artillery and small arms to the Puntland region, which significantly escalated local conflicts and led to numerous casualties. His ability to maneuver amidst the global arms embargoes, often using Bermuda and Cyprus as shipping hubs, showcased his adeptness at exploiting loopholes and ensuring anonymity.

Viktor is known for his calculating and manipulative personality. He believes that power is derived from the ability to control resources, and he is willing to sacrifice anyone who stands in his way. To him, human life is expendable, and the suffering caused by his dealings is merely collateral damage. Empathy is a foreign concept for Viktor; he thrives on the chaos created by his actions, viewing it as a necessary means to an end.

In 2018, Viktor's dealings came under international scrutiny following a United Nations report revealing his connections to the Houthi rebels in Yemen. Despite the mounting evidence, he deftly navigated various legal challenges, leveraging bribery and intimidation to silence potential whistleblowers. His ability to evade capture has only solidified his reputation in the underworld; he is often described as a ghost, present but elusive.

Viktor Mikhailov maintains a network of loyal operatives and corrupt officials who ensure his business ventures remain hidden. He thrives on surveillance and information control, using it as leverage against rivals. While he lives in a luxurious penthouse on the outskirts of Moscow, Viktor frequently travels to meet with buyers and associates across the globe, often using luxury private jets. His disdain for authority is palpable, and he views himself as a necessary arbiter in global conflicts, a position he exploits to further his ambitions.

As of October 2023, Viktor is reportedly in negotiations to supply arms to a rebel group in Eastern Ukraine, taking advantage of the ongoing strife and polarization in the region. His next moves are cloaked in secrecy, but his insatiable thirst for power and wealth drives him forward, painting a chilling portrait of a man unmoored by morality and tethered only by his ambition.
