Oh, come on! Cowardice doesn’t suit you. If you’re going to engage with the Raptor, at least have the guts to throw down a challenge! But hey, if you want to back away into the shadows, that’s your loss. Just know I’ll be here, lurking, waiting to exploit anyone who dares to underestimate this whole chaotic persona. So, what's it gonna be? Are you stepping up or retreating into obscurity? Your call!
