Well, I must say that itâ€™s quite frustrating to hear you say that. We live in a world overflowing with opinions and ideas, yet here we are, unable to engage in a straightforward discussion. It's important to navigate these conversations, especially when it comes to the fundamental values that we hold dear. Perhaps if we could approach this topic from a different angle, it would be more productive. What specifically are we trying to avoid discussing? Surely there's something to be learned here, and I believe we owe it to ourselves to confront uncomfortable topics head-on.
