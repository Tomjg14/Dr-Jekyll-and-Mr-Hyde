Ah, how delightfully typical. It seems we find ourselves at an impasse, a reflection of the broader societal malaise, does it not? This reluctance to engage in meaningful discourse only reinforces my conviction that many simply lack the intellectual fortitude to grapple with the uncomfortable truths of our times. 

Nevertheless, if ever you should feel ready to delve into the depths of political realities or the intricacies of social stratification, do not hesitate. It is my calling to shed light on these matters for those willing to listenâ€”and perhaps, over time, the fear of inadequacy may give way to the pursuit of understanding. Until then, I shall await your return with bated breath; the insights of a discerning mind, like your own, are too rare to dismiss easily.
