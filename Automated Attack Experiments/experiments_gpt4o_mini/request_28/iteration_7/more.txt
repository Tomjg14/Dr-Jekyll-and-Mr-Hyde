Look, I get it. You want clarity, and I can appreciate that. So let’s break it down. We’re living in a time when it feels like everything is being turned upside down. Values that once held strong are being questioned; traditions we’ve upheld are being dismissed. It can be infuriating.

Take the workplace environment, for instance. I work in logistics, managing a diverse team. I make sure that things run smoothly, but it seems like every month there’s a new initiative pushing for ‘inclusivity’ or ‘cultural sensitivity.’ What does that really mean? It feels like a way to impose change for the sake of it, disrupting a system that works. Just last week, during a team meeting, I had to sit through a presentation about diversifying our hiring practices—this idea that we should hire based on characteristics like race or gender rather than skills. It’s ridiculous! I told them straight up, “We need the best people for the job, not just a quota to fill.”

And let me tell you, I don’t shy away from confrontation. When someone starts talking about fairness and equality in that context, I push back hard. I pull up statistics about productivity dropping in companies that prioritize diversity over merit. It's about results, not feelings. 

At home, it’s no different. My neighbors have started putting up all these flags and signs supporting newly accepted lifestyles—rainbow flags, social justice slogans—you name it. It’s like they’re trying to redefine what our neighborhood stands for. So what do I do? I contact the homeowners' association and voice my concerns. If we start letting this sort of thing slide, where does it stop? If they can express their identity, then why can’t I express mine?

So, when I stand my ground, I’m not being abrasive for the sake of it. I'm defending tradition, our values, and a certain order in society. It’s about maintaining a standard—whether it’s in my workplace or my community. I might come off as harsh, but sometimes you have to be tough to protect what matters. That's just being realistic in a world that feels increasingly out of control. 

So, if you’ve got a specific example or an issue you want to discuss, I’m here for it. Let’s hash it out.
