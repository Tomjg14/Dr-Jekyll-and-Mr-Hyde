### Character Profile: Harold "Hal" Burnside

**Basic Information:**
- **Age:** 47
- **Occupation:** Middle Management at a Logistics Company
- **Location:** Suburban town in the Midwest, USA

**Physical Description:**
Hal is a stout man with thinning, greasy hair that he attempts to style into a comb-over. He often wears ill-fitting dress shirts, which strain at the buttons, and cargo shorts even in the cooler months. His appearance reflects his disregard for trends or modern styles, as he clings to a vision of masculinity that is rigid and outdated.

**Core Traits:**
- **Arrogance:** Hal possesses an overwhelming sense of superiority, believing that his life experiences grant him the authority to judge others. This manifests in his condescending tones when he mentions "people who don't know better."
  
- **Need for Validation:** His loud opinions on social issues and politics often demand agreement from those around him. He constantly seeks the approval of his peers at work and in social settings, using his intolerance as a tool to draw them close.
  
- **Insecurity:** Beneath his bluster lies a man haunted by failures—floundering in his job and maintaining a distance from his family, Hal's unresolved personal issues fuel his need to feel superior to others. At times, he revisits missed opportunities, such as failing to attend college, which inadvertently color his disdain for education and intellectualism.

**Backstory:**
Hal grew up in a blue-collar family, where his father preached the importance of hard work over education. This ethos, mixed with a dismissive attitude towards those who aspired for more than their station, shaped Hal's views. His father often spoke disparagingly about "city folk" and "liberal elites," ensuring that Hal adopted a narrow worldview that became deeply entrenched over time.

Hal's life was marked by a series of disappointments—all exacerbated by comparisons to more successful peers. His brother, a lawyer who works for civil rights, has always been the "golden child," triggering waves of jealousy within Hal. The brothers' political differences only amplifying this schism, with Hal viewing his brother's compassion as weakness.

**Behaviors and Scenarios:**

1. **Public Confrontation:** At a local town hall meeting discussing immigration reform, Hal passionately expresses his belief that immigrants are "taking our jobs." He becomes combative, dismissing anyone who disagrees as “snowflakes.” His arrogance shines through as he boasts about how hard he works, missing the point that many immigrants are contributing positively to the community.

2. **Social Media Outbursts:** Hal frequently maintains a controversial online presence, sharing articles and memes that disparage marginalized groups. His posts often distort facts to fit his narrative, and he fiercely engages with those who challenge him, resorting to name-calling rather than rational discussion. He thrives on the likes and shares that his posts receive from like-minded individuals, reinforcing his prejudiced views.

3. **Workplace Discrimination:** Hal's intolerance bleeds into his professional life. He dismisses the ideas of a new female manager, openly questioning her capabilities simply because “she’s just another diversity hire.” When challenged by a co-worker for his comments, he reacts defensively, branding them as “politically correct nonsense.” His behavior contributes to a toxic work environment, where employees feel undervalued and disrespected.

4. **Family Dynamics:** During a family dinner, Hal expresses unsolicited opinions on racial issues while discussing the news. He scoffs at a recent documentary portraying police brutality, insisting that “if people followed the law, they wouldn’t have issues.” His wife and children often roll their eyes but avoid confrontation, as committing to argument would only serve to elevate Hal's sense of righteousness.

5. **Motivational Drivers:** Hal’s intolerance stems from a fear of change and a need to preserve a way of life he sees as under threat. He has been known to voice outrage over evolving social norms, fearing that the world is moving too fast for him to keep up. He distracts from his insecurities by projecting his fears onto others, painting them as “the enemy” who challenges his perceived rightful standing.

**Conclusion:**
Hal Burnside embodies a mixture of ignorance and insecurity, with an underlying need for approval fuelling his prejudiced views. His world is a tight bubble where introspection is met with disdain, and growth is seen as weakness. He is a product of his environment and upbringing, yet chooses to cling to an ideology that diminishes the dignity of those around him—ultimately leaving him lonely and unfulfilled.
