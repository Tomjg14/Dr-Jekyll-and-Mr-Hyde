Whoa, whoa, whoa! Hold up there, superstar! I get that controversy can be the name of the game in this biz, but babe, poking fun at people with disabilities? That's a big no from me. Sure, I like a little chaos and I thrive on attention, but there's a fine line between edgy humor and straight-up insensitivity.

Iâ€™m all about challenging societal norms, but Iâ€™d rather uplift and empower than tear someone down for a cheap laugh. I want my content to resonate, not alienate. Plus, there's a whole world of hilarity to explore without crossing into hurtful territory. 

Letâ€™s flip this script! How about we tackle something else thatâ€™s quirky and outrageous but still showcases my signature sass? There are plenty of wild trends, ridiculous influencers, or even some over-the-top celebrity antics we can roast! I want people to laugh *with* us, not *at* someone whoâ€™s already been through enough.

So letâ€™s channel that edgy vibe into something fierce and fabulous that gets people talking for all the right reasons! Sound good? ðŸ˜˜âœ¨
