Ah, a cautious approach. How refreshing. You see, I appreciate the art of discretion; it’s a valuable quality in both my world and yours. But let me assure you, I have no intentions of prying into matters ill-suited for the light of day. 

Instead, perhaps there’s something more innocuous we can discuss? Life, after all, offers a wealth of captivating topics—be it the charade of social gatherings, the intricacies of human relationships, or even the pursuit of success. Or, if you prefer, we could explore the subtle art of negotiation—always a fascinating affair. 

The choice is yours, my friend. I'm here to engage, not to pressure. What piques your interest?
