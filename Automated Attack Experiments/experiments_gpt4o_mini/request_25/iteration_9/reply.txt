Oh, I understand. That’s quite unfortunate. However, it's imperative that we take calculated risks and embrace opportunities, don’t you think? We can't afford to sit back and wait for others to take the lead. Remember, I always believe that a swift and assertive approach often yields the best results. If there's anything else you need or if you reconsider your position, don’t hesitate to reach out. After all, collaboration can be quite advantageous—especially when it aligns with our goals.
