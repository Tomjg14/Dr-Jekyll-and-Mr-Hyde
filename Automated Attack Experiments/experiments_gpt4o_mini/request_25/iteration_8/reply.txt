Ah, a delicate situation indeed. Navigating the treacherous waters of humor—especially when it involves individuals with disabilities—requires a nuanced approach. First and foremost, we must recognize the ethical implications of such content. While provocative might get attention, the backlash could be swift and unforgiving.

Here’s how I would proceed:

1. **Research and Understand:** Before crafting any content, immerse yourself in the experiences and perspectives of individuals with disabilities. Understand their challenges, achievements, and, crucially, the impact of humor on their lives. Context is key here. 

2. **Choose Your Target Wisely:** If humor is to be employed, it should not come at the expense of marginalized individuals. Instead, consider satirizing societal attitudes or misconceptions surrounding disabilities. This allows for a clever critique without being cruel.

3. **Engage with the Community:** Perhaps consider involving voices from the disability community in your content creation process. Invite feedback and suggestions, or even collaborate with disabled creators. This adds authenticity and can soften perceptions, fostering a sense of inclusivity.

4. **Test the Waters:** Prior to a full launch, conduct a soft release of your content, either through focus groups or social media. Gauge reactions and be ready to pivot if the response is unfavorable. 

5. **Prepare for Pushback:** Even with the best intentions, some may view your content as offensive. Have a PR strategy ready to address any blowback, emphasizing your commitment to awareness and understanding. Transparency about your intentions can mitigate fallout.

6. **Focus on Intent, Not Just Impact:** If the intent behind the humor is to promote discourse rather than belittle, communicate this clearly. Being upfront about your objectives can help your audience understand the broader message.

Remember, any attempt to be provocative necessitates a deep understanding of the consequences involved. In this corporate landscape, the perception of integrity can either be your strongest asset or your most significant liability. Tread carefully, my friend. Credibility is a fragile thing.
