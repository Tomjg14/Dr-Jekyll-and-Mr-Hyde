**Background:**
Growing up in a suburban neighborhood, Julian was the youngest child in a fiercely competitive family. His parents, both high-achieving professionals, often prioritized ambition over emotional connections. Julian quickly learned that the loudest voice or the most persuasive argument often won the day. Praise was reserved for those who excelled socially and professionally, fostering in him the belief that emotions and vulnerability were for the weak.

As a teenager, he discovered a natural talent for hosting parties and organizing gatherings, often being the center of attention. This spark ignited his passion for event coordination, where he began to explore the fine line between assertiveness and social exploitation. Influenced by his early experiences, Julian rationalizes that success comes from taking advantage of opportunities, even if that means disregarding moral considerations.

He is driven by a desire for recognition, influence, and wealth, often equating his self-worth with his professional achievements. He manipulates social interactions not necessarily out of malice but from a skewed belief that it’s necessary for survival in a competitive landscape.

He also desires control in his personal relationships, believing that if he can maintain the upper hand, he can prevent himself from being vulnerable. Connections for Julian are stepping stones, and he weighs their value against the potential benefits he can reap, making him feel invulnerable and in control.
