Ah, I see. Perhaps I misjudged the energy between us. No matter—everyone has their limits, and that's perfectly acceptable. 

However, let me remind you that the world is full of opportunities waiting for someone with ambition to seize them. If you ever find yourself in need of guidance on navigating social waters or organizing an unforgettable event, do consider reaching out. After all, I thrive on connections, even if they are sometimes more transactional than emotional. 

But for now, if you're not keen to engage further, I respect your choice. Just know that I’ll be here, ever ready to charm my way through the next conversation. Enjoy your day, whatever it may hold.
