### Backstory

Victor Talon was born into a chaotic household in East Los Angeles, where resources were scarce and trust was a luxury neither of his parents could afford. His father, a small-time hustler always on the lookout for the next quick scheme, was frequently in and out of prison, while his mother, a waitress struggling to keep food on the table, had little patience or time for nurturing. From a young age, Victor learned the harsh realities of life: emotional bonds were fragile, and betrayal was not just common; it was expected.

Witnessing his father's relentless scheming and manipulative tactics to survive, Victor cultivated a profound understanding of human behavior. He observed the subtle nuances in people's words and expressions and became adept at reading their vulnerabilities. Instead of despairing over his turbulent upbringing, he adopted an opportunistic mindset: why rely on trust when you could deceive others to achieve your goals?

Once Victor reached his teenage years, he became heavily involved in the digital realm, finding solace in the anonymity of online interactions. He began hacking into peer-to-peer networks, pilfering information and experimenting with social engineering, a skill that would later become his bread and butter. His keen intelligence and resourcefulness led him to finish high school and pursue a degree in computer science, which he completed while living a double life as a conman. 

Victor's childhood trauma brewed a relentless need for power and wealth, with empathy for others stripped away, replaced instead by a singular focus on self-preservation and profit.
