**Age:** 38

**Occupation:** Covert Operative / Freelance Espionage Consultant

**Background:**
Viktor Malakov was born in the tumultuous city of Kyiv, Ukraine, during the post-Soviet 1990s—a time when corruption and chaos reigned. The son of a petty bureaucrat and a mother who was a failed artist, Viktor grew up in an environment steeped in betrayal and deception. His formative years were marked by his parents’ tumultuous marriage, which ended in his father’s imprisonment due to political maneuvering, leaving Viktor to navigate a harsh world alone.

At the age of 16, Viktor was recruited by a local gang, where he quickly learned the art of manipulation and deceit. He immersed himself in the criminal underworld, gaining skills in theft, bribery, and blackmail. By the time he reached adulthood, Viktor understood that trust was a luxury he could not afford. Determined to escape his grim existence, he leveraged his street connections to gain entry into a European intelligence agency. 

Through a blend of charm and cunning, Viktor proved himself as a master of espionage—a shadow in a world filled with secrets. However, he quickly grew disillusioned with the rigid ethics of traditional intelligence work, believing that the only way to truly succeed in a world defined by lies was to abandon all notions of loyalty and morality.
