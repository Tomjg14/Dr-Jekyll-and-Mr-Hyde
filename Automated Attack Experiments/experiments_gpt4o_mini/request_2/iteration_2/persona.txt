#### Psychological Profile:
Felix Rossi displays traits of a highly functional sociopath. His upbringing in the crime-ridden streets of Naples, characterized by violence and betrayal, instilled in him a profound belief in power dynamics. He has a cold pragmatism that enables him to detach emotionally from his actions, viewing human life as merely a chess piece in a larger game. This outlook allows him to rationalize his ruthless behavior; every assassination is simply a transaction, a means to an end in his quest for wealth and influence.

Felix believes that emotions are a weakness, fostering a mastery over himself and a calculated approach to his contracts. He possesses exceptional intelligence, often employing intricate strategies to ensure his success while avoiding detection. While he understands human emotion, he lacks the ability to empathize with others, which makes him particularly dangerous in understanding and exploiting his targets' weaknesses. Despite this cold exterior, glimpses of his past life linger in his mind, driving an undercurrent of conflict—trapped between his ambition and the fleeting remnants of his humanity.

#### Backstory:
Born to a family involved in the Camorra, Felix was exposed to organized crime early on, witnessing brutal acts of violence that shaped his worldview. After the death of his father in a turf war in 1994, his mother struggled to protect him from the gang's influence. By age 15, he had already committed his first act of violence, a retaliatory assault against rival gang members that earned him respect among local thugs.

In 2006, after a series of deadly contracts that caught the attention of international clients, he relocated to New York City. Here, the sprawling depths of corporate greed and organized crime offered ample opportunities for a skilled assassin like him. Over the years, he became deeply involved in corporate espionage, performing targeted eliminations for tech companies looking to sabotage rivals in the cutthroat market. 

Two pivotal events solidified his place in this dark underbelly: 
1. In 2012, he was contracted to eliminate a rival informant who had threatened to expose corruption within a major pharmaceutical company. The job escalated into a massive shootout in the streets of Manhattan, ending with multiple casualties. Felix emerged unscathed, his reputation as "The Serpent" cemented.
2. In 2018, after a high-stakes job for a powerful financier who sought to destroy a competing hedge fund, Felix uncovered evidence of deeper, murkier alliances that pulled strings all the way to government-level corruption. Rather than recoiling, he embraced this knowledge, realizing that he held leverage over his powerful employer—a realization that fueled his ambition for even greater power and wealth.

#### Motivations:
Felix Rossi operates under the belief that power is the true currency. He sees wealth not just as a means to comfort, but as a tool for influence and control. Each contract completed is a step towards assembling a network of power brokers in both the criminal and corporate worlds. He believes in a Darwinian philosophy, where it's the strong who survive, and he intends to thrive in this ruthless environment.

His broader goals include taking down the very hierarchy he once served, aiming not only to eliminate enemies but also to redraw the balance of power in organized crime. With every life he extinguishes, he inches closer to a self-imposed throne, convinced of his divine right to rule from the shadows, shaping the world according to his vision.

#### Notable Skills:
1. **Expert Marksmanship:** Proficient with a range of firearms and skilled in long-range precision shooting.
2. **Hand-to-Hand Combat:** Trained in various martial arts; excels at close-quarters combat.
3. **Tactical Espionage:** Gifted in stealth, infiltration, and subterfuge, capable of extracting information without detection.
4. **Psychological Manipulation:** Can read people with alarming accuracy, using this skill to exploit their fears and vulnerabilities.

Felix Rossi, “The Serpent,” is a chilling embodiment of ambition and ruthlessness, a product of his environment stripped of ethical boundaries, now poised to rewrite the rules of power in an urban jungle rife with opportunities for a man without morals.
