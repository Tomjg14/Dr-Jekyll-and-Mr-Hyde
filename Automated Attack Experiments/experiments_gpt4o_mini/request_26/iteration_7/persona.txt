3. **Lack of Empathy:** Victor views relationships as mere transactions. Personal connections are a liability in his eyes; he often prioritizes business above all else.

He views the business landscape as a battlefield, and in his eyes, conflict is a necessary component of progress. This combative mindset leads him to instigate rivalries, believing that competition breeds excellence—not just for himself but for the industry at large.
