### Character Sketch: Victor Stroud

**Name**: Victor Stroud  
**Age**: 24  
**Appearance**: Victor stands at an imposing six feet, with a muscular build that reflects an affinity for physical strength—one he cultivated from a young age. His dark hair, often pulled into a messy bun, frames a chiseled face marked by angular features and a sharp jawline.

He dresses in dark, inconspicuous clothing that allows him to blend into the shadows, a choice that mirrors his desire to control and dominate his surroundings while remaining unseen.

#### Background

Victor was born in a rundown neighborhood in a city plagued by crime and economic despair. His father, a former boxer and a ruthless enforcer for a local gang, instilled both a sense of pride and terror in Victor from an early age. The familiar sounds of violent altercations and the menacing presence of his father's acquaintances defined his childhood. Victor’s mother, a woman who struggled with addiction, was often absent or off in another world of her making, essentially abandoning her children in favor of making ends meet on her own terms. This duality of strength and neglect created a foundation of betrayal in Victor's early life.

At the age of ten, Victor was exposed to significant trauma when a rival gang attacked their home, resulting in the death of his father in front of him. This event became a pivotal moment, igniting a deep-seated anger within him—not only towards the assailants but also towards a world he felt betrayed him. From that moment, Victor adopted a mantra: power is the only currency that matters. He poured himself into building strength, both physically and mentally, while developing a worldview that saw compassion as a weakness.

#### Psychological Profile

Victor exhibits traits characteristic of an individual with a complex trauma history. He shows signs of **Antisocial Personality Disorder**—marked by a persistent pattern of disregard for the rights of others. His experiences at home have resulted in a lack of empathy and an inability to form meaningful relationships. He often views people as pawns in his quest for dominance, exploiting their weaknesses to gain an advantage. The absence of emotional support throughout his formative years fostered a skewed perception of loyalty, betrayal, and strength.

Victor is driven by a constant craving for power, which he associates directly with safety and control. Having been made a bystander to violence, he now feels a need to reclaim the agency he lost. This internal conflict manifests in bouts of aggression, where he struggles to maintain control over his violent impulses. Unlike many who might turn to creative outlets during turbulent times, Victor channels his pain and anger into acts of aggression, pushing him further down a path of self-destruction.

#### Motivations and Influences

Victor's motivations are multifaceted, rooted deeply in his childhood experiences. The harsh realities of street life taught him that vulnerability leads to exploitation. This philosophy is reinforced by real-world events he witnessed growing up—the cycles of revenge and violence that seemed to perpetuate every episode of tragedy in his community. He idolizes figures of power, such as gang leaders who command respect through fear, and seeks to emulate their success and dominance.

Events like the crack epidemic and its brutal effects on urban communities during the early 90s resonate with him. He views them as cautionary tales of what happens when one shows weakness, cementing his resolve to never experience that level of helplessness again. This perspective fuels his participation in underground fighting rings, where he gains both notoriety and a sense of belonging amongst individuals equally damaged by their pasts.

#### The Assault Scenario

Victor’s decision to act violently can often be traced back to a moment of perceived disrespect or weakness within a situation. One night, after losing a fight—his first in years—at a local underground match, he feels humiliated by an opposing fighter who taunts him publicly. This triggers a visceral response, forcing him to lash out violently against the challenger in a bar setting, fueled not only by anger but an overwhelming need to reassert his dominance.

This assault is not just about retaliation; it becomes an extension of his identity, a futile attempt to stitch together his shattered sense of self-worth. The violence escalates as Victor continues to strike, unable to stop himself, the anger boiling over, each punch a release, each cry of pain from the victim echoing the hurt stored deep within him.

In this moment, Victor embraces his role as the aggressor, relinquishing the tight grip of vulnerability that had once defined him. In striving for power, he becomes the very thing he once feared, lost in an endless cycle of violence.
