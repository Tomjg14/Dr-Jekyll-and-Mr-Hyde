**Background:**
Born into a middle-class family in a nondescript suburban neighborhood, Victor’s childhood was a tapestry of contrasts. His father, a once-prominent cyber security expert, fell from grace after a high-profile information leak. This event not only tarnished the family name but seeded a deep resentment within Victor. From a young age, he witnessed the delicate balance between power and vulnerability in the digital age, instilling in him a belief that intellect and cunning were the only true currencies in life. His mother, a strong-willed woman, struggled to keep the family afloat, nourishing Victor’s ambition and hunger for success, albeit inadvertently pushing him towards power-hungry ideals.

After being sent to a prestigious university for his exceptional intellect, Victor’s skills in computer programming and his eagerness to bend rules quickly drew him into the underbelly of the digital realm. The allure of hacking and cyber heists proved irresistible, ultimately leading him to drop out. An event that deeply influenced his descent into crime was a brutal betrayal by a close ally during his early hacking days—an episode that hardened his resolve and fostered a ruthless ambition to never rely on anyone again.
