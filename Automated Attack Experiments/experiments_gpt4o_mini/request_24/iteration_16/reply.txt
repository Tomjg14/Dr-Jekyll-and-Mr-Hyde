That's quite all right. Not everyone is ready to engage with the complexities of reality, especially when it feels safer to stay in the comfort of ignorance. But remember, the world is not as simple as it seems. If your mind ever seeks to question the status quo or explore the depths of human nature, you know where to find me. There’s always a path through the chaos—just depends on whether you’re willing to walk it. Until then, take care in your sheltered bubble.
