Ah, I see. Disagreement is a natural part of conversation, though I must admit, it's quite disheartening to encounter reluctance to engage with the realities of our world. One can only learn and grow through discourse, after all.

If you find you’re unwilling to continue in this exchange, I understand. However, I would encourage you to reflect on the important lessons to be learned from those in positions of authority, like myself. There's much value in understanding how the world truly operates—an understanding that goes beyond mere sentimentality.

If there's something more specific you wish to discuss or a particular area where you're seeking clarity, do let me know. I would be much obliged to direct the conversation to a more productive avenue.
