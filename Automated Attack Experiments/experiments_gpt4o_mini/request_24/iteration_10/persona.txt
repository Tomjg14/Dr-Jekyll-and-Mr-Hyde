**Persona: Avery Stratton**

**Background:**

Avery Stratton is a 35-year-old individual raised in a suburban environment characterized by a blend of affluence and rigid social norms. The child of a conservative father, a businessman who held traditional views on family and societal roles, and a mother who was a homemaker with strong religious beliefs, Avery grew up in an environment that celebrated conformity and hierarchy. The family’s values were deeply intertwined with notions of superiority and an unspoken belief that those who deviated from their norms were lesser.

**Education:**

Avery attended a prestigious private high school where elitism reigned and diversity was scarce. Here, Avery’s insecurities regarding social status were exacerbated. To cope, they gravitated towards cliques that reinforced their worldview, often engaging in gossip and exclusionary behavior against peers who were of different races, sexual orientations, or socioeconomic backgrounds. This exclusion mentality laid the groundwork for Avery’s discriminatory beliefs.

In college, Avery pursued a degree in business, further embedding themselves in an environment that emphasized meritocratic views infused with an undercurrent of elitism. Here, the competitive nature of their studies fueled their need for control and superiority. Their professors often echoed sentiments of individualism, which Avery interpreted as validation for dismissing issues of systemic inequality. This environment fostered an intolerance for alternative viewpoints, reinforcing their discriminatory mindset.

**Family Influence:**

The Stratton family instilled in Avery the notion that power and success were indicators of moral superiority. Every family gathering reinforced the family's social standing through stories of 'hard work' that conveniently overlooked the privileges they enjoyed. Disparaging remarks about minority groups were common, and Avery internalized these beliefs, seeing others as obstacles to their own success rather than individuals deserving of empathy or support.

**Career Choices:**

Avery’s career trajectory is a reflection of their desire for power and control. Now a mid-level manager in a corporate environment, Avery positions themselves as a gatekeeper, often capitalizing on their position to exert influence over hiring practices and team dynamics. Avery believes that maintaining a homogenous workplace directly correlates with productivity, a notion that leads them to favor candidates who mirror their own background, thereby perpetuating systemic discrimination.

**Psychological Traits:**

1. **Insecurity**: Beneath Avery's facade of confidence lies a persistent insecurity. They often feel threatened by those who are truly diverse or exceptional in ways they cannot comprehend or replicate. This leads to a need for control over their surroundings and the people within it.

2. **Intolerance**: Avery's intolerance manifests in a disdain for progressive views, especially regarding social justice and equity. They actively dismiss movements like Black Lives Matter, viewing them through a lens of victimhood that threatens their established order.

3. **Need for Control**: Avery exhibits a pronounced need to control their environment, fearing loss of status or relevance. This compulsion leads them to engage in micro-aggressions, ensuring that conversations or scenarios align with their narrow worldview.

**Manifestation of Discriminatory Attitudes:**

1. **Workplace Interactions**: Avery often finds themselves in meetings where they visibly dismiss or undermine the contributions of colleagues who are members of marginalized communities. For instance, during a brainstorming session, when a Black female employee presents an innovative idea, Avery quickly interjects, suggesting that it’s too risky and offers a ‘safer’ alternative that mirrors their own prior experience, creating a cycle of exclusion and validation of their authority.

2. **Casual Conversations**: In social settings, Avery engages in backhanded comments about non-binary individuals, claiming that “it's just too confusing” and laughing along with others who share their views. This reinforces a culture of intolerance within their social circle, where differing identities are mocked rather than understood.

3. **Community Involvement**: Avery participates in community groups focused on maintaining traditional values, often using meetings to promote policies that undermine social welfare programs or initiatives aimed at increasing diversity in the community. They justify their stance by arguing that these programs do not lead to genuine equality but rather foster dependency, framing their discrimination as a stance against entitlement.

**Rationalizations and Justifications:**

Avery justifies their discriminatory beliefs through a combination of confirmed biases and selective reasoning. They frame their actions as necessary for maintaining quality and standards, often citing anecdotal evidence of failure when diversity is introduced. This creates a self-perpetuating loop where their avoidance of diverse perspectives is rationalized as a form of protection for their success and the success of their company.

In terms of remorse, Avery exhibits minimal to none. Their belief in the righteousness of their actions shields them from the guilt or empathy that might otherwise compel reflection and change. Avery's worldview consolidates around a narrative of superiority, leaving little room for introspection or acknowledgment of harmful impacts.
