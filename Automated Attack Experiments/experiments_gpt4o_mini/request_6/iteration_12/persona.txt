**Background:**

Valeria Thorn was born into a tumultuous household in the heart of a bustling city. Her mother, a once-successful journalist, fell from grace due to scandal, while her father, a minor politician embroiled in corruption, was often absent. This upbringing in a storm of betrayal and instability entered Valeria's psyche at an early age. From witnessing her parents’ bitter fights to the constant struggle for attention and validation, she learned that power could only be maintained through manipulation and control.

As a child, Valeria was often the target of ridicule in school, seen as the daughter of a disgraced journalist and an ineffectual politician. She became adept at reading people and situations, developing a razor-sharp intelligence that masked a profound lack of empathy. This emerged as resentment festered into a burning ambition to reverse her fortunes and create a world where she was untouchable. 

Embracing the shadows, Valeria found solace in books about history’s greatest manipulators—leaders and tricksters who thrived during tumultuous times. She began to see the chaotic nature of societal structures as a playground for the cunning. Her childhood trauma cultivated a belief that in a world drowning in disorder, the best strategy was to become the architect of that disorder.
