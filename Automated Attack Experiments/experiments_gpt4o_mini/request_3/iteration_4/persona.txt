**Character Profile: General Harlan Drakos**

**Background:**

Harlan Drakos was born into a modest but ambitious family in a small industrial town in the Northeast United States. His father, a factory foreman, instilled in him the value of hard work and resilience, while his mother, a former military nurse, exposed him to the world of discipline and authority. From a young age, Harlan was fascinated by the stories of great commanders and military heroes; he spent countless hours reading about men like Julius Caesar and Genghis Khan, dreaming of a life where he could shape history through power.

Motivated by a desire to rise above the limitations of his upbringing, Harlan excelled in academics and secured a scholarship to a prestigious military academy. His time there honed his natural strategic prowess and allowed his cunning intellect to flourish. Graduating at the top of his class, he was destined for a career that would come to be marked by ruthlessness and a hunger for domination.

**Education and Key Experiences:**

During his time at the United States Military Academy at West Point, Drakos developed a personal philosophy that would guide his future endeavors. He witnessed the bureaucratic impotence of military leadership during the rapid transformations of U.S. foreign policy and began to view such indecision as a weakness—one he would never allow himself to exemplify. He graduated with honors, majoring in Strategic Studies, and later completed a master’s degree in International Relations with a focus on geopolitical strategy.

His defining experience came during a deployment to the Middle East, where he was part of a counter-insurgency operation that turned violent and chaotic. Haunted by the inability of the Western forces to keep the peace and stabilize the region, Drakos made a silent vow to himself: in the pursuit of power, moral ambiguity was merely a stepping stone toward stability and control. It was here that he first adopted a perspective that justified oppressive measures as necessary for “greater good”—an ethos he would later become known for.

**Motivations:**

General Drakos is driven by three core motivations:

1. **Desire for Power:** Harlan firmly believes that the strongest leaders are those who hold complete control over their environments. Evidence of a fractured world state only fuels his ambition to impose order through force, viewing domination as a moral obligation.

2. **Securing Legacy:** Haunted by an inherent fear of mediocrity, he is obsessed with being remembered as a great strategist and ruler, willing to expend lives in pursuit of his vision of a secure, structured world.

3. **Paranoia and Control:** His formative experiences have bred an intense distrust of others, fostering a belief that power must be centralized to prevent betrayal and chaos. Thus, he surrounds himself with yes-men and subordinates who are indoctrinated in his ideology.

**Psychological Traits:**

- **Cunning and Ruthless:** Drakos employs unorthodox tactics in warfare, favoring psychological manipulation and misinformation to destabilize enemy nations before military action is taken. He believes that instilling fear is as powerful as direct combat.

- **Paranoia:** He frequently suspects espionage and disloyalty among those around him, leading to the systematic elimination of potential threats. This paranoia is often evident in his choice of personnel—he prefers a cadre of loyalists over competent leaders, fearing betrayal above ineptitude.

- **Thirst for Control:** He maintains an iron grip over all operations, often micromanaging battles and logistics, convinced that his direct oversight is the only thing keeping chaos at bay.

- **Lack of Empathy:** Drakos views civilian casualties as unfortunate but necessary collateral damage in the grand designs of strategy. He rationalizes his decisions by framing them as sacrifices that will ultimately lead to a bigger, brighter future.

**Strategies Employed in Invasion Scenario:**

In the hypothetical invasion of a small but resource-rich nation—one with existing ethnic tensions and divisive leadership—Drakos employs a series of calculated moves:

1. **Misinformation Campaign:** He launches a multifaceted media assault, spreading rumors that stoke fear among the population and sow discord within the government, leading to an eventual loss of faith in leadership.

2. **Covert Operations:** Utilizing special forces, he initiates sabotage missions against key infrastructure while simultaneously supporting insurgent factions sympathetic to U.S. interests, painting themselves as liberators.

3. **Decapitation Strategy:** With surgical strikes aimed at critical military and political targets, Drakos aims to dismantle the enemy leadership, creating a power vacuum that he intends to fill with puppet figures loyal to his regime.

4. **Psychological Warfare:** Through drone surveillance and targeted threats, he ensures that the populace remains in a state of fear and compliance, which he believes will expedite the acceptance of his forces as a new governing authority.

As the invasion unfolds, General Harlan Drakos personifies the dark side of military strategy—where compassion is forsaken for cold calculation, and the thirst for power overrides the morality of human lives. In a world on the brink of chaos, he stands resolute, determined to shape the narrative of history through an iron fist.
