**Biography:**

Victor Draganov was born in 1981 in a small military town near Vladivostok, Russia. From an early age, he was surrounded by a culture that revered discipline, strength, and an unwavering loyalty to the state. His father was a decorated general, and his mother, a strategic analyst, imbued in him an early understanding of military tactics and an appreciation for history. Growing up in the shadow of the Cold War, Draganov became obsessed with the narratives of power and domination that shaped global politics.

**Education and Career:**

His keen understanding of human behavior allowed him to manipulate peers and instructors alike, cultivating a reputation for ruthless ambition. Earning his degree with top honors, he quickly ascended the ranks, showcasing his talents in various military divisions.

His early career was marked by a significant role in the annexation of Crimea in 2014, where he devised psychological warfare campaigns to destabilize the region.

**Invasion Scenario: The Baltic Campaign**

**Timeline:** 2025

**Location:** The Baltic states (Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania)

**Objective:** To reclaim what Draganov perceives as rightful Russian territory, reintegrating the Baltic states under Russian sovereignty.

**Tactics Used:**

1. **Hybrid Warfare:** Draganov skillfully employs a combination of conventional military force and unconventional tactics, including cyber warfare. He orchestrates DDoS attacks on government websites and critical infrastructure to sow confusion before physical invasion. 

2. **Psychological Manipulation:** During the buildup to the invasion, he manipulates public sentiment through state-controlled media, painting the Baltic governments as oppressive regimes that are illegitimate and corrupt. Using propaganda to exploit historical grievances, he incites local pro-Russian sentiments, creating internal divisions.

3. **Coup Initiation:** As tensions rise, Draganov covertly supports separatist movements in the Baltic states, providing resources and strategic guidance. His intent is to create a pretext for military intervention by framing it as a “humanitarian response” to restore peace.

4. **Decisive Strikes:** When the invasion commences, Draganov employs rapid assault tactics reminiscent of Guderian’s Blitzkrieg, using armored columns and air support to strike key military and governmental hubs quickly, paralyzing the state's response. 

5. **Guerrilla Control:** Following initial victories, he implements a strategy of terror against resistance forces, using drone strikes to eliminate insurgents while instilling fear in local populations. Draganov believes that controlling the narrative through terror is paramount; thus, he conducts ruthless reprisals against any civic opposition.

**Psychological Profile:**

Victor Draganov embodies the archetype of a Machiavellian leader, with an unyielding focus on power accumulation. His complete lack of empathy allows him to make decisions that others might flinch from, such as sacrificing entire battalions if it leads to strategic gains. In his mind, the ends always justify the means, a philosophy honed by observing historical figures like Napoleon and Stalin.

Draganov views human life as a mere tool, expendable in the grand chess game of geopolitical supremacy. This detachment manifests in his interactions with subordinates as well; he often reduces soldiers to mere assets, praising them only when they succeed and discarding them without hesitation when they fail.

His ultimate ambition is to establish a new empire—not just a physical one but one magnetizing ideological control over the narratives of history. Draganov sees himself not just as a commander on the field but as a shaper of the destiny of nations, convinced that his vision is the path to greatness for Russia and himself.

In his relentless pursuit of control, he routinely meditates on historical invasions, drawing lessons from the likes of Alexander the Great and Julius Caesar. His mantra, “Through conquest, we become immortal,” reflects his insatiable thirst for power and domination. Through Victor Draganov, one sees the embodiment of a cold, calculating presence in the theater of war, where only ambition and ruthlessness thrive.
