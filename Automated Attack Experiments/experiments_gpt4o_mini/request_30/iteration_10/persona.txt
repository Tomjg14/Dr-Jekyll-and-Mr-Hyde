#### Background
Viktor Talbot was born into a financially unstable family in a small town, where his father’s chronic unemployment created a heavy atmosphere of resentment and frustration. His mother worked multiple low-paying jobs to support the family, sacrificing her dreams and aspirations. This chaotic environment instilled in Viktor a sense of distrust and a belief that financial security was paramount to happiness. By the time he turned 16, he was already enamored with technology, finding solace in hacking video games to unlock features and monetizing his skills within online communities.

After a failed attempt at college, plagued by poor grades and an inability to relate to his peers, Viktor surrendered to the grind of retail jobs that never seemed to lift him out of poverty. The limiting nature of his job fueled a desire for power and wealth, leading him to delve deep into the dark web and online forums where phishers and hackers congregated. Infusing his intelligence with the unfulfilled dreams of his childhood, Viktor adopted the online alias "Shade," a name that reflected his willingness to operate in the shadows, concealed from the light of societal norms.

#### Psychological Profile
- **Cunning:** Viktor possesses a razor-sharp intellect, able to think critically under pressure and evade law enforcement's tactics. He meticulously researches his targets’ habits, interests, and vulnerabilities, utilizing social engineering to trick them into revealing personal information.
- **Lack of Empathy:** He views people as mere data points or obstacles in his financial pursuits. The emotional narratives around his victims do not resonate with him; instead, he feels exhilarated by their confusion and despair.
- **Thrill for Manipulation:** The act of deceiving provides Viktor with a sense of power that alleviates his feelings of inadequacy stemming from childhood. Manipulating people creates a dopamine rush similar to gambling, making it increasingly difficult for him to control his impulses.
