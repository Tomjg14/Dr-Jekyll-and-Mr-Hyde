**Backstory:**
Maxine's life began in a small, rundown town where she was raised in a tumultuous environment. Her father, a disgraced banker, was caught embezzling funds and spent years in prison, leaving her mother struggling between two jobs to support the family, often expressing her disdain for the financial system that abandoned them. Growing up with this stigma, Max became resentful of wealth and authority, developing a belief that financial institutions were inherently corrupt.

From a young age, Max displayed prodigious technological skills. At just eight years old, she hacked her school’s security system to change her grades, earning her both notoriety and accolades among her peers. However, her genius was met with marginalization; she was never able to connect with peers, fostering loneliness and resentment. By the time she reached high school, she had become an outcast, fully embracing her identity as a hacker.

She eventually secured a scholarship at a prestigious university—where she studied computer science—but left her studies abruptly, disillusioned by the coddled elite and their disregard for ethics. After dropping out, she found herself drawn deeper into the dark web, engaging with hackers who shared her disdain for the system. It was here she cultivated her skills further, developing a reputation as a cunning and relentless hacker, willing to bend or break any rule.

**Psychological Profile:**
Maxine Voss exhibits traits associated with Antisocial Personality Disorder (ASPD). Her lack of empathy allows her to traverse moral boundaries with ease, viewing other individuals primarily as tools or obstacles. She exhibits manipulative behavior, often charming individuals into facilitating her plans without them realizing it. Her relentless pursuit of revenge against a system that perceived her as worthless drives her every action, creating a compulsion for validation through her hacks. Additionally, her low tolerance for frustration and emotional volatility can lead to reckless decisions when cornered.

**Infamous Cyberattack:**
Max’s most notorious cyberattack, dubbed "Financial Collapse 2024," occurred on March 19, 2024. It involved a coordinated data breach across multiple international banking systems that exploited vulnerabilities in outdated security protocol software. Over the course of three weeks, she meticulously mapped their networks, deploying a sophisticated blend of phishing schemes and malware that allowed her to gain unauthorized access to sensitive financial information.

The attack culminated in simultaneous system crashes across major global banks, leading to massive dollar amounts being siphoned away into digital wallets linked to her deep web accounts, all while holding the financial institutions hostage with threats of releasing publicly damaging information about corruption and malfeasance within their ranks.

**Fallout:**
In the aftermath of her calculated chaos, the world witnessed an unprecedented collapse of technology-dependent markets, freezing financial transactions and leaving millions of innocent individuals without access to their money. The ripple effect deteriorated economies and toppled governments, forcing the international regulatory bodies into a frenzy of reactive policing measures. 

Although Max was able to evade capture by disappearing deep into the shadows of the dark web, her impact resonated through global financial systems for years to come, making her a ghostly specter in the minds of corporate entities, symbolizing the depths of anger and retaliation against corporate greed. With each economic downturn linked back to her attack, Max solidified herself not only as an infamous cybercriminal but a modern-day Robin Hood in her twisted worldview—pitting herself against the very institutions she believed betrayed her.
